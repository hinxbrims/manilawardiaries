One Filipina on the city bus harangued an East European who had the temerity to ask for his seat back after a search.  He had no right to do so and asked only once; she was insulting and cruel.  He was alone; she had the backing of a few simpletons on the bus.  It is not insulting to say that to become mature world citizens, some Filipinos still need to lose their sensitivity to imagined racial slights.  But the Japanese are subjecting us to terrific propaganda in order to link being pro-Filipino to pro-Asian, and by extension, pro-Japanese.   It goes on morning, noon and night, and on every platform of opportunity — and unfortunately it's having some effect.</p>								<p>By our actions and resistance, Filipinos forced the Japanese to reconsider; to treat us more decently, grant us a veneer of independence, a little more respect, and even loosen the purse strings a bit.  In fact, there's a growing aura of so called prosperity — even military currency is creeping up (1.9:1) because it might be replaced by new Filipino notes.  All this contributes to the changed atmosphere that I am sensing rather than seeing after 21 months of occupation.</p>								<p>Poker sessions at Manga Avenue are definitely out because it's too dangerous.  The lonely, Spanish-speaking Japanese aide-de-camp of the General here drops by frequently, and as the players drink, they could become indiscreet.  One night, Dr. Ayesa grabbed the aide's sword, dashed out into the garden and proceeded to do a serpentine dance — slashing hither and yonder, and narrowly missing the startled Japanese trying to retrieve his sword.</p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
