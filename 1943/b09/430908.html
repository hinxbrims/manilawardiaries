Knowing it was past curfew, I got out of bed, crawled warily to the front porch, and got a scare when the car parked right in front of our house.  The men got out but went to the gate across the street.  I found out later that the Military Police took Peter Siy away (one of the finest fellows in this block) as well as about 15 others including a Neighborhood Association fellow who came to investigate.</p>								<p>The Japanese are conducting a campaign in Panay, and this time they are dispensing with any pretense of goodwill.  They get hold of a town's census then ask the leaders to call everyone listed down from the mountains ... <i>or else</i>.</p>								<p>A weakened and slightly shaken Mrs. Kyburz was released due to lack of evidence.  They didn't take anything of hers though they accused her of aiding guerrillas.  No doubt they knew she helped Santo Tomas internees, but guerrillas?</p>								<p>Manuel Roxas, our top hero, is still a prisoner in his Taft Avenue house because he hasn't signed or taken an oath of allegiance to the Japanese.  He's not being guarded though the gardener at his residence is Japanese.  To visit him you'd need a pass from the Military Police, who keep an eye on his every activity and an ear on his phone line.</p>								<p>The Americans had a plane waiting three weeks for Roxas when they were evacuating, but he chose to stay.  For that, he paid a stiff price — malaria, a terrific cold that led to bronchitis, and eventually Tuberculosis of both lungs due to malnutrition.  He plays on his illness and military prisoner status to hold back the Japanese, and he still believes the Philippines can dodge their request to declare war.</p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div>				<!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">			<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="710" align="left">			<tr align="center">				<td align="center" valign="top" width="55">					&nbsp;				</td>				<td align="center" valign="top" width="200">					&nbsp;				</td>				<td align="center" valign="top" width="246">				<br><span class="inLink"><a href="#p1">- Top -</a></span>				</td>								<td align="center" valign="top" width="209">					&nbsp;				</td>			</tr>		</table>	</div>	<!-- ***************** PAGE 2 ***************** -->				<a name="p2"></a>	<div class="header2">		&nbsp;	</div>	<div class="main2">		<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="710" align="center">			<tr align="center">				<td align="center" valign="top" width="55">					&nbsp;				</td>				<td align="left" valign="top" width="655">			<div class="inLink">| <a href="#p1">Pg.1 Today's Stories</a>| Pg.2 |			</div>				<span class="date r">Supplement</span>				<span class="date">September 8, 1943</span>				<p>Got a letter this evening from Joe, dated August 15, saying Camp morale is fast improving — an indication that they've been getting the news.
