"Mussolini Rescued by German Troops" — paratroopers.  Locally, the Tee-Han-Kee assassins were executed.</p>								<p>Snapshots of Manila under occupation: A couple of boys herding a flock of goats through Santa Mesa.  A cart on automobile tires loaded with scrap being inched painfully up the Santa Mesa Bridge by six struggling men.  Lots of small offices and buy-and-sell shacks — one does bicycles, shoe repair, groceries and miscellaneous.  The two by four-foot "Theo R. Manufacturing Company" shack under the bridge with a working lathe.  The nouveau riche buy-and-sell crowd spending in the Astoria.  Penny and I watched two start with malted milk and cake, move on to sundaes and more cake, then one finished with a coffee while the other picked his teeth — Schaer can pick 'em from a mile away.  The gigolos are gone.  Sharkskins are scarce.  A guy's shirt and pants had more patches than original material — I couldn't tell if he was kidding or not.  Cars and buses stuck on the road, some being towed.  Twenty people dashing from carretela to carretela shouting their destinations — the cocheros so uppity these days that they never deign to answer.  Streetcars so full the conductor has to lean on the doors to shut them.</p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
