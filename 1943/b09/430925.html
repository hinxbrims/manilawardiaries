So there I was, stranded ... but not alone.  From all walks and distances people kept flocking to the place.  The papers will call it a spontaneous gesture of enthusiastic attendance, but the following were required to attend:</p>								<ul>					<li>Members of the Federation of Manila Retailers</li>										<li>Neighborhood Association leaders</li>										<li>All pupils and school teachers</li>										<li>Workers of PRIMCO and other government employees</li>										<li>The Constabulary (even a delegation from the Baguio Military Academy)</li>										<li>Off-duty nurses</li>										<li>Employees of all Japanese firms</li>				</ul>								<p>I figure the crowd numbered 100,000 by 1145; the papers will probably put it at 200,000; a Japanese Army spokesman will estimate it at 300,000; E.M. will say 400,000; and the Commentator will top them all.  I met only one fellow I knew, Mario Hernandez.  His first words to me were: "Don't tell me you have to be here also!"  As a member of the Retailers Association, he said he had to attend "or else."</p>								<p>Tribune: "Reorganization of Metropolitan Constabulary Impresses Service."  There is bad blood between the regular and Metropolitan Constabulary — someone called the <i>city boys</i> "crooks."  The new Economic Police Division, established for some four months now and still only available for consultations and hearing public complaints, are the boys who will really clean up.</p>								<p>Commentator is now listed as "By Don Juan De La Cruz, Commentator" to make it appear that he's Filipino.  He's not, and the "Don" gives him away.  The Japanese want to wash their hands of him — the articles are that bad.</p>								<p>La Vanguardia: "Laurel is the President of the Republic of the Philippines," and Aquino is Speaker — both unanimously elected by roll-call vote.  "The members of the Assembly had to announce their choice in spite of the fact that there was no other candidate."  They did have a choice: Laurel or Fort Santiago.</p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
