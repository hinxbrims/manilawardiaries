They spent three days together in one room, eating, sleeping and waiting, enduring occasional sneers or rare kick from their captors.  Lunch and dinner of rice and <i>pechay</i> [bok choy] was served, and empty sacks were supplied for use as pillows.  Questioning began on the first night â€” some took half an hour, others up to three hours.  Finally, they were all shunted to Santo Tomas.  Eight days later, eleven were released with an apology, and as for the rest, rumor has it that some will get prison sentences.</p>								<p>Incidentally, Kodaki went to Tokyo recently to protest against the interference of the Japanese Military Police in matters concerning the internees.  Before he left, he gave a speech asking the internees to behave, or at least not get caught breaking the rules.</p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
