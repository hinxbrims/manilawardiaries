I called him from a public phone, saying, "This is Paco B."</p>								<p>"Voy a ir Vicente, por la ma√±ana, temprano" [I'll go Fred (for Friday), early in the morning].</p>								<p>He didn't show up so I paid him a visit.  On Thursday, the Japanese took him to Fort Santiago and interrogated him on his USAFFE connections.  The Japanese told Manolo that they had been watching him for weeks so he'd better 'fess up.  They quizzed him on recent visitors (my name didn't turn up though I visited him twice).  They asked about a Buster Brown from Shanghai Life Insurance.  Showing them his watch, Manolo said he only bought a watch from Brown, a known watch-seller.  They asked him whether the Adamson brothers were listening on the radio, but he didn't know them.</p>								<p>Failing to get any useful information from Manolo, the Japanese asked if he would cooperate and "watch things for us in your neighborhood."  He had to agree in order to protect his family.  I left him as he had an appointment with a Japanese man at the Fidelity Restaurant "for instructions."  My radios will have to wait.</p>								<p>Manolo thinks Ernest Berg snitched on him.  Berg recently discovered a microphone in his office and traced the wires to Fort Santiago, so he figured the USAFFE were listening in on him before the war, and Manolo, an employee then, had placed the wire.</p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
