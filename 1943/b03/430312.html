				<p class="first">Tribune: "New [motion] picture will depict Japanese onslaught in Bataan."  Filming in Manila begins around March 20, with Filipinos and eight leading Japanese actors in the cast.  The title is "Down with the Stars and Stripes."</p>
				
				<blockquote>The Filipinos are expected to represent the conditions in the USAFFE during the Japanese attack on the American positions; how the Filipinos, on account of their color, were treated with contempt and used as human barricades to enable the retreat of their American comrades will be depicted with bitter realism.</blockquote>
				
				<p>Got my radios yesterday.  A sticker inside says that No. 56, Rufino Punsalan, did the reconditioning "carefully."  He did too, judging by the complaints of others.  In fact, five or six reconditioners ending up in <a href="../../mapper/intramuros.html">Fort Santiago</a> for pilfering, swapping parts, or losing whole radios.  Rufino took out my oscillator coil, jammed the wavelength switch to disable shortwave, and managed to mix up the tone control with the volume control; but longwave works fine.</p>
				
				<p>While hunting for Radio Tokyo at 2100 tonight, I heard a broadcast say, "And 14 Japanese planes were shot down."  I increased the volume and jumped as a peal of lightning struck.  I looked out the window as another peal roared through the speaker.  I toned it down, ran out to straighten my old aerial and dashed back in to find the news was finished.  I got the point â€” I'll be back at 1185 kilocycles tomorrow.</p>
