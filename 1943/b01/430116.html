It simply said:</p>								<blockquote>10/12/42<br>Received four packages this date.<br>J.A. Brimo</blockquote>								<p>Father Theo wasn't able to get any packages to the prisoners since July — until the Japanese relaxed conditions in December 23.  Hendricks received five packages and wrote a long letter to Manila.  He said there were 16,000 prisoners up there now, 7,000 of them ill.  Dysentery and Malaria is prevalent because of the poor diet.</p>								<p>The camp is asking for a long list of medicines and other items.  I've been tasked to find some 40 dozen handkerchiefs [I'm having the material cut and hemmed already] and arrange for other clothing.  I made Schaer promise to donate 20 liters of alcohol for the next trip. </p>								<p>Some American prisoners continue to work at the Manila piers.  One described as tall, thin and bearded dropped dead the other day.  It's hard work for the poor diet, though a few are opening and helping themselves to some of the boxes destined for Japan — shoes, canned milk, even the occasional beer drank warm on the spot.  There's so much stuff in the piers that one prisoner worried there wouldn't be anything left in the city!</p>			        				<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">			<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="710" align="left">			<tr align="center">				<td align="center" valign="top" width="55">					&nbsp;				</td>				<td align="center" valign="top" width="200">					&nbsp;				</td>				<td align="center" valign="top" width="246">				<br><span class="inLink"><a href="#p1">- Top -</a></span>				</td>								<td align="center" valign="top" width="209">					&nbsp;				</td>			</tr>		</table>	</div>	<!-- ***************** PAGE 2 ***************** --><a name="p2"></a>	<div class="header2">		&nbsp;	</div>	<div class="main2">		<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="710" align="center">			<tr align="center">				<td align="center" valign="top" width="55">					&nbsp;				</td>				<td align="left" valign="top" width="655">			<div class="inLink">| <a href="#p1">Pg.1 Cabanatuan Notes</a>| Pg.2 |			</div>				<span class="date r">Supplement</span>				<span class="date">January 16, 1943</span>							        <h3>Country News</h3>				<p class="first">The provinces are seething everywhere.  In Nueva Vizcaya there are plenty of guerrillas.  Two truckloads of Japanese soldiers about to enter a town were annihilated in an ambush.  In retaliation, the Japanese bombed the village, killing 18 and wounding more.  A friend from there was contacted by the USAFFE and asked for a donation to "further the cause."  He gave, but scared that the Japanese would find out, fled to Manila for an "indefinite" stay.</p>								<p>In Tuguegarao, one side is quiet, but just across the river it's no man's land.  Pork there sells for 25 centavos a kilo because they can't ship it out.</p>								<p>Aparri doesn't even have a government tax collection agent.  It's safe inside the city, but try getting there....  It's such a long time since tobacco was brought down from the Cagayan Valley that factories in Manila are running out — only Tabacalera has enough stocks for the moment.</p>								<p>Both the Tribune and Vanguardia reported that "because of the inadequacy of transportation facilities, no reports are available from the municipality of Palawan."</p>								<p>Down south is even worse.  As one Japanese officer put it: "Visayan people — very bad."  A recent traveler said the guerrillas in Cebu are "real USAFFE men" — disciplined, controlled and efficient.  Japanese troops sent south to ostensibly annihilate the guerrillas can only guard the "safe zones" and towns they occupy.  They're so mad that when a batel of Visayan civilians fleeing the fighting recently landed in Lucena, they were slapped around and detained.</p>								<p>Surigao in the northern tip of Mindanao is relatively quiet, but elsewhere, particularly in Oriental Misamis, there is hell to pay.</p>				<p>The tough people in Samar and Leyte who gave the early Americans many a headache years ago are now dishing it out to the Japanese.</p>			</td>			</tr>		</table>	</div>	<!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer2">		<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="710" align="left">			<tr align="center">				<td align="center" valign="top" width="55">					&nbsp;				</td>				<td align="center" valign="top" width="200">					&nbsp;				</td>				<td align="center" valign="top" width="246">				<br><span class="inLink"><a href="#p1">- Top -</a></span>				</td>								<td align="center" valign="top" width="209">					&nbsp;				</td>			</tr>		</table>	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
