The punch was not strong enough but I'm thankful now.  Only thing is, at midnight, some of the girls were nearer to crying than cheering.  The night was bright, cool and full of stars so plenty of people stayed up hoping to see some excitement.  It seemed as if all Manila was out.</p>								<p>So it's a New Year.  No free calendars this year — buy them yourself — stamped "Approved by the Japanese Military Administration."  Everyone is asked to display a Japanese flag tomorrow for the Anniversary of the Japanese Occupation — a holiday.</p>								<p>Manila greeted 1943 with confidence the Japanese wouldn't last the whole year.  I have yet to meet a single person who believes Japan will win the war.  Common topics: What's going to happen to the Japanese military currency?  Will America fight or wait to get the Japanese out after they surrender?  Will the war end this year, or will Germany be beaten this year and Japan a couple of months later?  Will the Japanese act like savages, or leave in good order?  Some people expect them to go berserk and burn all the buildings.  Most agree that if an American invasion is necessary, the ports, Corregidor, and Cavite will be bombed.</p>								<p>The typical Editorial said, "Ever since the granting of the Gracious Imperial Rescript Declaring War on the United States and Britain, the Imperial Japanese Forces have been victorious everywhere."  Only if you've been reading the Japanese press.</p>								<p></p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
