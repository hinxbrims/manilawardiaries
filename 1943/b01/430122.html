Assuming they could bring their radios anytime that day, Schaer sent his brother-in-law at 1300.  For being late, the Japanese took him into a room, shut the windows and beat him up a bit, then ordered him to call Schaer in within 30 minutes.  Schaer immediately took a carretela but couldn't make it on time, so they beat him too.  A raging Japanese officer administered the punishment, including blows with the blunt end of his saber.  He spat and cuffed him more after finding out he was Swiss, ordering a Filipino policeman to take over while he caught his breath.</p>								<p>When Schaer got home, he climbed into bed â€” virtually deaf, teeth loose, and his face swelling under ice packs.  Two doctors are with him now.</p>								<p>The Astoria is the city's most popular restaurant and confectionery, and Schaer, a well-respected Swiss, has friends of all nationalities including Germans and Japanese.  All who know him are shocked with fear and anger.</p>								<p>Another fellow who got cuffed-about today is 65-year old Campos, who lives in our street and is a respected member of the Spanish Community (and pro-Axis, I think).  He enjoys driving his own carretela artfully.  Today unfortunately, he happened to hit the tail lamp of an auto driven by a Japanese civilian.  For that he got cuffed, abused, and had to pay for the damage.</p>								<p></p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
