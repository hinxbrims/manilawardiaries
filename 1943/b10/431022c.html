After a moment I looked up at him and said brightly: "Just got a letter from Joe.  He's all right."  Schaer was looking away at a wall painting.</p>								<div class="image right" style="width: 130; margin-top: 15px; margin-left: 8px; margin-right: 5px">					<img src="his_way.jpg" border="0" width="130" height="68" alt="movie">				</div>								<p>Later I ducked into the Times Theater where the Japanese film <i>His Way</i> was playing.   I really wanted to see the final edition of the <i>Daitoa News</i> and the first edition of the <i>New Philippine News</i>. The Times Theater was practically empty — probably the smallest crowd it has had in many months — and this despite a high-class vaudeville.  The revenue loss will be terrific until American pictures are allowed again.</p>								<p>The Daitoa News was a typical summary of war developments from December 8 to October 14 — very poor propaganda.  The New Philippine News was about the independence program of October 14.  It had a very comical scene: After Laurel's speech, who should break into wild applause but Aquino — looking like his old self — a squirrel.  But he was too quick on the trigger.  The crowd's applause was so small that it made Aquino look like a one-man barker at a vaudeville show, trying to stir up enthusiasm in an otherwise bored audience.</p>								<p>There was a glimpse of the National Assembly meeting in which Laurel was elected "unanimously."  He strode up in <i>magnifico</i> style as the boys patted him and laughed.  Alunan was especially forward in yelling, "Mabuhay."  I noticed because Alunan is no friend of Laurel by any means.  Oh well, all life's a stage.</p>								<p></p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
