Only it never works.  For example, new fixed prices for carretelas are half to one-third of recent rates and both cocheros and passengers will ignore it.  Said one: "15 centavos to Mandaluyong?  We're all willing to pay 30 provided that rate could be enforced.  When it rains, they charge us 50!"</p>								<p>Pete Siy is out after three weeks in Fort Santiago.  He was fed only rice, sometimes salt as a special treat and once in a while two half-inch pieces of sweet potato.  On the first night he was tied up, placed in a cell, and told to think it over carefully.  "When we come back you tell us what you did that was wrong."</p>								<p>Pete had no idea what to say.  He got slapped, cuffed and kicked around, then given two days of rest followed by 24 hours of continuous interrogation, including a mild version of the water treatment.  Strapped to a bench on his back a tube of running water was placed in his mouth.  "One must fight the urge to take a big breath or the water goes down the wrong pipe."  It lasted almost an hour before they let up.</p>								<p>A complete stranger accused Peter and several others of paying him to do the job on the Japanese that were killed in Santa Mesa last June.  He even claimed they gave him a gun, which he duly returned.  When the Japanese caught the real culprit (Reyes) Pete and the others were automatically absolved though not immediately released.  They're all out now except for the snitcher.  Said Pete: "If you don't cave in and confess, they know you're not guilty, for the Japs know how to torture."</p>								<p>A fellow named Oriol (of Oriol Marble Works) accused of printing guerrilla war notes may be in Fort Santiago.  People say he typed and distributed broadcasts from foreign stations.</p>								<p>What does the cancellation of the extra ration of sugar by PRIMCO in September have to do with beer?  Chemist Krile of San Miguel Brewery is using fermented sugar as a Malt substitute.  For the Japanese Army and Navy to have their beer it takes 2,000 sacks of sugar a month â€” the equivalent ration for 200,000 people.  For the civilians to have their beer another 100,000 have to forego their sugar rations too.  That makes beer a super-prime commodity.</p>				<p></p>				<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
