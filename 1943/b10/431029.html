Two Foe Cruisers Sunk."  It seems we landed in Mono Island, 60 kilometers south of Buin, Bougainville.  The convoy had "more than ten transports and many large-sized landing launches, escorted by cruisers and destroyers."  The Japanese "anticipated" this attack, sank two destroyers — but not a single transport or launch?</p>								<p>They also claim downing 8 out of 320 planes "which raided the Nippon military positions at Buin."  That's 8 out of 320!  On page 2 they claimed downing 27 out of 33 on October 25 over Bougainville.  I wouldn't be surprised if the 33 mentioned were really 330 minus a trailing zero — missed deliberately or in error.</p>								<p>Based on the U.S. claim that they can build a plane every five minutes, Commentator estimates America will produce 105,000 planes in 1944.  But, "Japanese production capacity has kept pace ... the plan to produce 150,000 combat planes a year is actually being realized."  Ah, that's where the missing zero went.</p>								<p>Efforts to create a legend around Laurel are in high gear.  Ignacio Javier devoted most of his broadcast to Laurel's exploits: Reduction of large salaries and increase of small salaries [the latter is an absolute necessity], visiting hospitals, writing to a widowed mother a-la-Lincoln, speaking to Constabulary graduates, and sending a message to Filipino youth.  The latest is reducing banquets to only one plate.  Well, he'll get enough in that one plate for a satisfying meal — something no one else gets downtown these days.</p>								<p>After two weeks of only local and Japanese films, the theater owners have had enough revenue losses.  American films are back on.</p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
