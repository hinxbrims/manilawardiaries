[Only two?]  "The President of the House of Peers will cable his felicitations."  Oh, okay then.</p>								<p>"Nine enemy warships, transports sunk or destroyed in Solomons" masks the Japanese retreat from Vella Lavella and Kolambangara, only they call it a "transfer to rear bases."  Of course, everything went smoothly.  They won't mention they lost a destroyer and 46 barges sunk.</p>								<p>The Tribune's recent slogan: "Our Freedom is Philippines; Our Prosperity Spheric."  Ephemeric, I'd say.</p>								<p>Editorial: "Let it never be said by our posterity and by history that the future Republic of the Philippines was ushered in with sham and hypocrisy."  You just said it.</p>								<p>Splashes: "Hoots and catcalls from the gallery won't stop the Big Show on October 14."  <i>Boo!</i></p>								<p>Commentator: "Imperial Wild Eagles Foil Plan to Terror-Raid Japan, P.I."  All about the U.S. 14th Air Corps in China bombing innocent civilians.  "If their native land is indiscriminately bombed, the Filipinos are quite capable of demanding that the culprits, once captured, be delivered into their own hands."  Oh Lord, I do hope so, how they will be feted!</p>				<p>Brainy-boy Laurel: "One Race, Language and Ideals."  Quote: "It did not take more than fifty years for Japan to absorb the best of modern civilization, including western culture, while at the same time conserving the <i>autochthonous</i> Oriental virtues."</p>								<p>Incidentally, all Manila is building arches of autochthonous [indigenous] bamboo and colored paper for October 14.  All Neighborhood Association Districts must have one, and all members must attend.  Manga Avenue is exempted â€” there's only one truly autochthonous family of two persons here.</p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
