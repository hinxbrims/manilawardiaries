I dashed out to get the Tribune, but that wasn't its Editorial.  The broadcast also said there was a "pandemonium of joy" in Manila.  The reality is closer to fear, doubt, remorse, confusion, anger, and futility.</p>								<p>Maharajah writes like a Filipino that he is.  Yesterday, he explained how a leg of chicken came to cost P1.50 in a city restaurant by tracing its added costs on the way in, including all the necessary bribes and gifts.  Today he bemoaned the fact that our control measures are unenforceable, citing typical responses when people point to fixed prices in the papers.  Cochero: "My rate is 30c, if you prefer Tribune rates [10c] then ride the Tribune."  Meat vendor: "Why buy mine, go eat Tribune meat, or Taliba pork."</p>								<p>A clever fellow figured out why the Japanese are whitewashing the railings of all bridges.  Not for the independence celebrations, he said, but in preparation for "night troop movements during black-outs."  Australian radio noted the Japanese were evacuating women and children from vulnerable Japanese cities and targets but not from occupied cities like Hongkong or Manila.</p>								<p></p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
