bombings,<br>				The guns stood grim and still.<br>				The smoke and haze of battle,<br>				Hung low o'er distant hill.<br>				The sun was slowly sinking,<br>				Her golden rays shot down<br>				Upon the dead and dying,<br>				And on the battle ground;<br>				And on one among the dying—<br>				A youth not yet a man<br>				Who was drafted from 'Dear Georgia'<br>				To fight in old Bataan.<br>				<br>				His brother knelt beside him<br>				As his life-blood ebbed away<br>				Bending his head in pity<br>				To hear what he might say.<br>				The dying brother looked up then,<br>				And whispered, 'Brother Jack—<br>				Take this message to our mother <br>				If ever you get back.'<br>				Jack's tears again fell faster<br>				As he clasped his brother's hand—<br>				To listen to the message<br>				He must take from old Bataan.<br>				<br>				'Tell mother how I died, Jack—<br>				On this wide battlefield,<br>				Where the bullets rained so thickly<br>				And flashing steel met steel.<br>				Tell how they used to promise<br>				They'd send men, guns and planes,<br>				And tell her how we waited Jack<br>				For ships that never came.<br>				How this hope was always burning<br>				In the heart of every man—<br>				Till at last we knew 'twas hopeless<br>				For the boys in old Bataan.'<br>				<br>				'Tell her how we fought Jack,<br>				Together side by side,<br>				And death which swept around us<br>				Was like a seething tide—<br>				Tell her how we lived, Jack...<br>				With only rice to eat,<br>				Boiled coconut, banana stalks<br>				And sometimes carabao meat—<br>				Tell her not to weep Jack,<br>				For, waiting I can stand<br>				At the Golden Gate in Heaven<br>				Built for boys from old Bataan.'<br>				<br>				'There was another, brother Jack<br>				A little Dixie gal—<br>				I'm sure that she is waiting<br>				Like a loyal, faithful pal.<br>				She kissed me as we parted<br>				And said "So long, John dear—<br>				I'll be waiting here in Georgia,<br>				In this town of old Macon."<br>				So take this little trinket,<br>				'Tis but a golden band,<br>				To my sweetheart who is waiting<br>				For her doughboy in Bataan.'<br>				<br>				'Now raise me up dear brother,<br>				So I may see the sun<br>				Gleaming on the Stars and Stripes<br>				Before the day is done.'<br>				He saluted to the flag—so slowly—<br>				A tear stood in each eye,<br>				As he said, 'Farewell, Old Glory,<br>				It's not so hard to die!<br>				Beneath your silken folds<br>				I nevermore shall stand,<br>				So—farewell—Glory—Mother—<br>				Sweetheart—Father—old Bataan...'<br>				<br>				And his brother saw him falter,<br>				So he laid him gently back,<br>				And heard him softly whisper<br>				'I must leave you now, dear Jack.'<br>				He saw his eyelids quiver		         <br>				As they closed so very slow.      		<br>				He realized his brother<br>				Was on this earth no more.<br>				'Oh God!  Receive this shattered soul—<br>				'Tis the brother of my childhood<br>				Who's just died here in Bataan.'<br>				<br>				That night the pale moon rose<br>				And calmly it shone down<br>				Upon a solemn little funeral<br>				On Bataan's scarred battleground.<br>				His buddies offered up a prayer<br>				Beneath a mango tree<br>				While some of them began to sing<br>				'Nearer My God to Thee.'<br>				Even the bamboo bowed their heads—<br>				There in the war torn land,<br>				While another lad was laid to rest<br>				In a grave in old Bataan.<br>					</blockquote>								<p style="text-align: right" class="inLink"><br><a href="431022c.html"> continues...</a></p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
