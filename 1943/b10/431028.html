The Japanese guard says to one, "Pikit" [shut your eyes in Tagalog].  The man does so, but nothing happens so he opens them again.  "Pikit," says the guard again, so the man shuts his eyes again — this time, tighter.  Still nothing happens so he opens them again.  "Pikit!" shouts the Japanese in a rage, slapping him twice until he shuts his eyes again in terror.  Tragedy was averted when a Filipino sentry arrived and explained that the Japanese guard only wanted to see his <i>ticket</i>.</p>								<p>A nouveau riche Buy-and-Sell man saunters up to the shoeshine establishment and takes a seat beside a friend of mine.  The shoeshine boy goes to work on his shoes.  The Buy and Sell man watches, fidgets a bit, then says, "S-ay, what's that paste you're using?  Is that genuine?"  The youth ignores him and continues with his job.  The Buy and Sell man fidgets again then shouts: "Hey, I don't like that.  Is that shoe polish genuine?"</p>								<p>The irritated youth looks up and replies: "Is your money genuine?"</p>								<p>Tribune: In the recent raid on Rangoon, Corporal Taniguchi "deliberately" crashed into and downed an enemy bomber.  However, he was able to bail out successfully.  "At the same time Sub-Lieutenant Ito also crashed his plane into an enemy craft to down another enemy bomber."  Yet, "he managed to make a successful forced landing at an undisclosed airdrome."  Pretty good feats, you might think.  But the top prize goes to a recent Nippon Times article in English: "Our bombers were on their mission, when suddenly three enemy fighters appeared.  Two of our bombers self-blasted themselves."</p>								<p>La Vanguardia: "Gift of Rice for the Philippines."  For independence, the Japanese will give us three tons of quinine [from Java], 25,000 sacks of rice [from Saigon], and one million yards of cotton goods [from here].  Of course, it will be given on three separate occasions accompanied by the usual dulcet phrases.  We've received the quinine already, the rice comes next, and the textiles will be given later — at least those that survived the white ants.  My guess is Burma is similarly getting quinine from Java, sugar from the Philippines, and so on.</p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
