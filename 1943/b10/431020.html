Mrs. Roxas greeted Aquino with: <i>"Well, so you made another speech."</i></p>								<p class="dialogA">Aquino looked up, knowing what to expect.  "Did you read it?" he asked cautiously.</p>								<p class="dialogB">"No," answered the Madame, "but I've heard about it — from MANY quarters."</p>								<p class="dialogA">"I suppose," said Aquino, getting the point, "that if I had made a pro-American speech you would have followed it completely."</p>								<p class="dialogB">"Oh sure," answered Mrs. Roxas, "but only in the papers — not on the radio.  Your English is abominable."</p>								<p>And that was only the beginning.  Over dinner, Aquino got quite a going over led by Roxas.  What Independence is this?  <i>What freedom?  How?  Where?  What?</i>  The gent didn't have a good time.</p>				<p>If Roxas gets the Red Cross post, he might have to do a little provincial traveling — and maybe get lost in the wilderness, so to speak.  He's trying to drag Juan Elizalde and Enrico Pirovano into the government.  Laurel is frowning because the two are white.</p>				<p>Tribune: "P.I. Now Enjoying Complete Independence says Aquino" — in a speech in San Fernando, Pampanga.  But read this: "The legislative leader developed this theme in a determined effort to answer the queries of some people as to the kind of independence which was proclaimed last Thursday."  It's not only Roxas who's unconvinced, but 95% of the Filipinos too.</p>				<p>"Laurel Forms Cabinet....  Foreign Ministry is Created....  Recto appointed Minister of State for Foreign Affairs."  Only now?  Why, he signed the alliance last Thursday!</p>				<p>Commentator: "On the first day of the Philippine Republic, the 18 million Filipinos ratified a treaty of alliance."  Like hell we did!</p>				<p>Today, Laurel and Recto slugged it out to convince Filipinos that the pact doesn't mean WAR unless we're <i>invaded</i>.  The Recto touch was there, but it was tinged with uncertainty.  He disappointed a lot of people.</p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
