Well, maybe 100,000 — most of them government workers who had to go.  Streetcar rides were free for the day.  Page two is all about the parade — luscious text, heavy, dripping — in fact, all wet.</p>								<p>Father Theo is leaving for Cabanatuan on Thursday — this time with full permission from the military.  They grilled him first: "How is it that you, a German, should want to help the Americans so often?"  He parried, but they pressed on: "But you're German, we're Japs — and allies — the Americans are our enemies."</p>								<p>"Ah," answered the good father, "when the Lord Jesus was crucified, there on the cross he told us to love our enemies."  That set the Japanese back for a 5-yard loss and Father Theo took the ball.  "Charity is the basis of the Catholic religion," he intoned solemnly.  "There are millions of Catholics in this country who would be aggrieved if you prevented my practicing a little charity now and then."  That was good for 25 yards and first down.  He continued: "February 11, Thursday, is Kigen-Setsu — Japanese Empire Day.  You must be charitable on that day and thus honor your Emperor and nation."

They must wear red armbands, stay at home, warn friends not to visit them, and fill out an extremely detailed questionnaire if they want to extend their stay outside.</p>								<p>'Sister' Mary Connor, who is out convalescing, said the shacks were closed for a week then allowed to reopen with all sides facing the street or main lane left open.  Of the four "pregnant fathers," one wasn't married and another was a missionary from Cebu.  Their penalty: 30 days in jail with only rice and water for the first week.  The internees rejected the commandant's suggestion early in the fracas ... for a red-light tent!</p>								<p class="center">...ooOoo...<br><br></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
