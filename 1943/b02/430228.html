				<p class="first">Last month's practice blackout enabled the Japanese to transfer sick and wounded from the piers to the <a href="../../mapper/sampaloc.html">Quezon Institute</a> secretly â€” arrivals from the Solomons.</p>
				
				<p>The German Club did have a meeting and one of their members is in disgrace for being too blunt.  He asked a lawyer to look into the possibility of putting his property under his wife's name because she's not German.</p>
				
				<p>Mrs. Menzi wondered why Captain Guido, head of the USAFFE Intelligence, should be let out and not Hans.  In other words, Hans belongs to the same group.  Figuring they were all going to be shot, one member told the Japanese the truth.  They asked him if he loved the Americans.  "Yes, they treated us well and we were happy under them."  And what did he think of the Japanese?  "I hardly know them.  It took the Filipinos many years to get to know the Americans, and it will take time for us to know you too."  (Good answer.)</p>
