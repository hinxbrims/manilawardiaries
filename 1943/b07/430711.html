Tojo lauds work of body."  What work?  Tojo made a little senseless speech and Laurel responded with the usual over-ebullient welcome.  Three pictures are all comical; the best one shows Laurel and Roxas entering the Manila Hotel — Laurel on his wheelchair, Roxas leaning on his cane and supported by a companion.  It looks like they're about to check into a hospital instead of hold a joyous independence conference.  The description of the event enables us to check the chronology:</p>								<div class="image left" style="width: 300; margin-top: 15px; margin-left: 24px; margin-right: 12px">					<img src="entering_hotel.jpg" border="0" width="300" height="278" alt="Entering Manila Hotel">					<div class="caption" style="margin-top: 11px">					Laurel and Roxas Entering<br>					the Manila Hotel					</div>				</div>								<p>The conference started at 1600, lasted 45 minutes, then they proceeded to the Manila Hotel's Winter Garden for a tea party.  Along the way, Roxas had a private word with Tojo and excused himself from the rest of the proceedings.  Say 5 minutes en route and 5 minutes to settle down at the table makes it a 15-minute tea party.  You can just imagine how happy everyone was.</p>								<p>Page 1: "100,000 Greet Tojo."  <i>Really?</i>  Splashes: "What's the use of having 400,000 people shouting Banzai and Mabuhay if we can't attend to a handful of guerrilleros?"<br><br></p>								<p class="center">. . . .</p>								<p>Stories doing the rounds:</p>								<blockquote>A friend's "A-1 source" has actually seen a guerilla blacklist with 56 names, including Strebel (25th on the list) and Roces Jr.  The source was reluctant to talk so he didn't press for details.
