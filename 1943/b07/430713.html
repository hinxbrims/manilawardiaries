Commentator says the U.S. should check Daihon-ei's "accurate and clear-cut announcements" to correct "mistakes and inaccuracies" before issuing their own reports.</p>								<p>One version of the sinking of the Banahaw.  The Banahaw was delivering cement for Palawan, where the Japanese are building an airfield at Puerto Princesa.  A submarine followed the ship right into the channel, leading the sole Japanese on board to conclude that it was friendly.  He had the Japanese flag raised, and a shell from the submarine promptly tore off the bridge.  The crew bailed out, but the Japanese stayed and went down with the ship — crying.</p>								<p>The Military Police in Iloilo took charge of the crew and detained an officer in Iloilo's <a href="../../mapper/intramuros.html">Fort Santiago</a>.  On hearing his story, the head of the Japanese Military Police banged the desk:</p>								<p class="dialogB">"An American submarine?  You must be mistaken."  [Bang!]</p>								<p class="dialogA">"But we saw it!"</p>								<p class="dialogB">"Saw an American sub?  You're wrong."  [Roar!  Bang!  Slam!]</p>								<p class="dialogA">"But it fired on us after we put up the Japanese flag!"</p>								<p class="dialogB">"Then the Japanese commander of the sub made a mistake!"</p>								<p class="dialogA">"We thought ... think...."</p>								<p class="dialogB">"You do nothing of the kind.  I tell you it was a Japanese submarine."</p>								<p class="dialogA">"Oh, all right."</p>								<p class="dialogB">"You understand?  It WAS a Japanese submarine!"</p>								<p class="dialogA">"Yes, sir, it was a Japanese sub."</p>								<p>The source of this story was also on a cutter leading a convoy of two merchant ships hugging the coast of Luzon, when both blew up within thirty seconds of each other.  The Japanese on board the cutter swept the horizon anxiously with his binoculars and watched the ships sink.  My source ventured to ask what happened.  The Japanese lowered his binoculars and fired a stern glance at him: "Probably engine trouble."</p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
