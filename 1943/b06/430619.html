All Set for Luneta Rally Today....  Filipinos to give thanks to Japan....  Mammoth throng expected at meeting — Vargas, Aquino will address nation."  It's to be a <i>gratitude rally</i>.  The pressure is on — everyone with an official position is quoted to be in support of independence; those against are branded as traitors — and you know what happens to traitors.</p>								<p>La Vanguardia's list of members of the Independence Preparatory Commission includes Manuel Roxas.  I can only imagine the kind of pressure it took to get Roxas to join the group.  Maybe they hinted that he could end up like Laurel, shot by an <i>unknown</i> guerilla or bandit.  Roxas is the only real patriot in the group; he's shown that he has guts and is nobody's <i>yes-man</i>.  He's the man to watch; that is, the Japanese had better watch out.</p>								<p>So here we are, tobogganing down the slippery slope of Japanese propaganda, submitted to a constant bombardment of editorials and articles.  The populace is quiet; all the talking is done by a handful of collaborators.  It's all right to point the finger at Recto, Sison and Yulo, but suppose they had opposed it — they'd be dead with no one the cleverer.  The Japanese are fighting a life-or-death battle — and they're becoming desperate.</p>								<p>And where is America?  It's been 14 months since that one-time bombing of Japan despite promises that more would follow.  FDR said, "Many roads lead to Tokyo and we shall neglect none of them," but the Japanese here remain untouched.</p>								<p>Meanwhile, we are suffering the fate of Frenchmen and Belgians, though their relationship with Great Britain is not the same as ours with the U.S.  Some Filipinos can't be blamed for feeling let down by the U.S.  Oppression is growing but is nowhere near the bursting point.  The climax will be reached on the day Filipinos wake up to find that conscription has already been enacted.  There will be an exodus into the mountains, but enough will remain to make it work.  We've already heard a report that high school students will have to undergo some military training.  No wonder increasing numbers are leaving school and seeking private tuition.  America had better hurry.</p>								<p>La Vanguardia: "Laurel very much better" — but the facts belie the case.  It's hard to keep a secret in this country.  Laurel's private nurse told Lolita that he is very weak, occasionally bleeding internally, and could possibly die.  Two doctors from the Philippine General Hospital admitted the same to Schaer.</p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
