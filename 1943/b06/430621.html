The article leads us to believe that Roxas was present even though he wasn't in the photograph.</p>								<p>Yet another Japanese was killed in Santa Mesa last night — that's four in two days!  The Military Police were all over the area.  Coming home in a dokar this evening, we got stopped and searched.</p>								<p>Last Saturday, Schaer went to a birthday party at Tom's Dixie Kitchen.  A Captain of the Military Police and his very drunk interpreter accosted and threatened him.  The captain stopped the interpreter from pouncing on Schaer.  Apparently, a friend of the interpreter from Quezon City had been recently killed.</p>								<p>Schaer and family headed home soon after, passing Santa Mesa at 2330 just after the killing reported yesterday had taken place.  Some 20 armed-Japanese in very bad mood were present.  Schaer was questioned and released.</p>								<p>He finally arrived home at midnight to find that a Japanese MP had been there earlier, waiting for Schaer.  Well, after three scares in one night, Schaer had Dr. Abad call Fort Santiago in the morning to ask if there was a problem.  An officer said they only wished to verify the day of Schaer's beating by a Japanese officer in Quezon City.</p>								<p>We're now wondering if the guy who beat Schaer up some time ago at Quezon City wasn't one of the recent murder victims (he beat up one person too many), and the interpreter who wanted to assault him at the party was probably the victim's friend.</p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
