Avanceña will preside over conference....  Government offices at disposal of PCPI" — a very short article.  The PCPI's first meeting was a washout — only 13 members attended.  Laurel was still in the hospital, and Alunan was away on a one-man mission to talk to Confesor.  (Some people hope he doesn't return, but his family in Manila would then become hostages.)</p>								<p>The Japanese thought they had an ace in the hole: Roxas!  According to one of his relatives, Roxas has constantly insisted to the Japanese that he was their prisoner and should be treated as such.  He was released from captivity and brought to Manila some time ago to recover.  The Japanese set him up in a splendid house in Dewey Boulevard, treated him well, allowed his wife to visit him, gave him the best food, wines and liquor — anything he needed and more.  They took their time.</p>								<p>Finally, very politely, even charmingly, they asked him to become a member of the PCPI, and maybe even the head of the current government.  Roxas was blunt: "I'm an officer of the U.S. Army and your prisoner," he said.  "How can I join another government?  It would be treason on my part."  The Japanese asked him to reconsider, and in the meantime, cut off all his privileges again, including visitors.</p>								<p class="center">. . . .</p>								<p>Another Japanese was killed at the Congress Hotel — all occupants were forced to evacuate.  At Pandacan, two policemen were killed in a gun battle as they rushed a house.  In Santa Mesa, Filipino policemen and bayonet wielding Japanese soldiers patrol around the clock.  A new special squad (with cars) at the City Hall is now on constant alert.</p>								<p>In Plaza Santa Cruz, the center of downtown Manila, a drunk and boisterous German accosted a Japanese civilian:</p>				<blockquote>Oh ho!  So you're a Jap!  You Japs are no good....  Why, you people have learned less in 2,000 years than the Filipinos have learned in 40 years.  The Filipinos are ahead of you ... smarter than you.  I want to see you tomorrow ... right here!  I haven't finished telling you what I think about those countrymen of yours!</blockquote>				<p>The crowd had melted away quickly, but a few reappeared to board an arriving cab.  The German repeated his challenge once more, then got on the same cab.  As it pulled away from the stunned Japanese civilian, the German collected a few Attaboys and pats on the back from passengers.</p>				<p class="center">. . . .</p>				<p>A girl just arrived from the mountains of Panay Island said the Japanese would never get Tomas Confesor; in fact, even if they happened to capture him, they wouldn't be able to recognize him.  Most Visayans, she said, think the people in Manila are cooperating and will get hell when the Americans return.  The lady has had all kinds of narrow escapes, including once when guerrilleros killed 30 Japanese near her home.</p>				<p class="center">...ooOoo...</p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
