They sink a cruiser or large destroyer and another destroyer, slightly damage two carriers, and shoot down two planes while losing 30 of their own.  Finally, a communiqué that does not sound ridiculously improbable.</p>								<p>"Laurel Back, Hails Joint Declaration."  He made it safely through the bad weather, disappointing a few here.</p>								<p>Commentator: "Japan's victory enhances joy of Independence Celebration."  Someone should tell him it was postponed.  He wants the U.S. and Japanese Navy to have a showdown somewhere in the Central Pacific — to decide the war <i>mano a mano</i>.</p>								<p>An article explaining suicide tactics seeks credit for Japan's brave sons, but as usual, goes too far by denying it to her enemies.  No one denies that Japan's soldiers are brave.  With swords or planes, the Japanese fight bravely — always, but arm them with a pen and they turn into cowards — always.</p>								<p>An angry Primco replied to the "idiotic questions" of Public Pulser Nestor José: "The answer is: 'Wake up and fall in line and don't be a damn fool!'"  A few lines later, they all but admit that there isn't enough cloth to go around.  Well, there was at one time.  The stores had to list their inventories before rationing took effect, then PRIMCO forcibly purchased textiles from the wholesalers (including Dad), promising the public that they would open up their bodegas if supply became scarce.  But they've been clothing Japanese soldiers and civilians that land here, as well as the Constabulary, police, and officials and employees of the government and Japanese firms.  Even Japanese women in town are wearing new dresses of American textiles.  After spoilage and reserves for next year's rations (it's a sure bet they will be cut and the price in points will be increased), there's not enough left.  So Primco bodegas remain closed — and Nestor had a point.  Incidentally, they complain that his name and address are false — they checked!</p>								<p>Another way to deflect blame is to blame others.  La Vanguardia reported yesterday that one Chinese was fined P20,000 for hiding textiles, and one Indian was arrested for the same offense plus attempting to bribe an agent with P500.</p>				<p>Last night's full moon is no more — it's been raining all day and the barometer has crashed.  Typhoons that arrive this late in the year tend to be severe.</p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
