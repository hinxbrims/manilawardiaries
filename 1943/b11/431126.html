On September 2, 1939, I was at his house listening to declarations of war while Adolf ranted and raved in the Reichstag.  The Japanese took his transmitter and special receiver long ago.

Need I add he hit something?  I've had a few such close calls, myself.</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
