Someone's in a big hurry.</p>								<p>"Nation honors its War dead ... in O'Donnell."  Note that it's a prison camp and not a battlefield like Bataan!  Tarlac Governor Sergio Aquino wants the camp to be made a National Cemetery.</p>								<p>Guerrillas derailed the Bicol Express near Sipocot, South Luzon.  The engine and the first two cars fell into a river or precipice, killing 30 and injuring 100 — the latter arrived in Manila this morning.  The line runs through the mountain passes between Hondagua and Sipocot — perfect terrain for guerilla warfare.  It's a standing rule in the train to not sit next to a Japanese officer in case someone takes a pot shot at him!  I hope Maurice wasn't on that train.</p>								<p>Gelano, just back from the provinces, predicts that "All hell will break loose there someday."  Provincianos say <i>Republica Japonesa</i>, instead of Filipina, because we have no freedom; the Japanese army lords it over "small fry" Filipino government officials while Japanese sentries get away with mayhem.</p>								<p>Two friends of mine recently dined as guests of the Japanese general forcibly occupying their house.  They were treated to splendid European cuisine — real butter, potatoes, plenty of beer, even a pack of Chesterfields each.  Servers bowed to the males at each serving, not the females.  The General said he always eats like that.  My friends think that if the Japanese lived simple and frugal lives before, it's because they had to.</p>								<p>A nurse at the Japanese Military Hospital (formerly Sternberg) says it's full of food and medicines.  Recent arrivals include many Japanese wounded from Burma.  According to Schaer, the Japanese at the McKinley hospital waste enough food for 250 people every day.  They put ten five-gallon drums of garbage out every night, eighty percent of which is leftover rice.  Schaer gets a barrel to feed his hogs and poultry.</p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
