Somebody ought to tell the Americans in Torokina Point about it.  Meanwhile the Americans have landed at Makin and Tarawa, in the Gilberts, following a week of bombing.</p>								<p>Four Chinese were arrested for selling cigarettes at two to three times the fixed price — the same price, incidentally, that every Filipino sari-sari store sells them for.  Hungry Filipinos insisting on paying fixed prices almost rioted against the Economic Police in the Pasay market.  Their leader yelled: "Go ahead, shoot!  Either your bullets or starvation — it doesn't matter.  What kind of life is this anyway?  Is this what Laurel means by Independence?"  If fixed prices were enforced, the stores would have to close and the Economic Police wouldn't be able to supplement their meager P50-a-month salaries.</p>								<p>Never has Japanese prestige been so low as today.  No one believes their constant claims of victories.  The average Filipino has no reserve left; you can see the hatred in their faces when they look at the Japanese.  Conductors on the streetcars are openly sabotaging the Taiwan Electric Company.  More than 80% of the Neighborhood Association groups are not patrolling anymore.  Fixed prices are a joke but they continue to be fixed well below market prices every day.  The National Assembly Investigation Committee is powerless.  Textiles are gone but Primco continues to issue useless ration tickets to selected groups.  Graft is everywhere.  Laurel has suddenly gone quiet.  His spectacular cabinet meeting after the typhoon has become meaningless.  If a government employee has to travel some distance to his office half his salary would be gone on transportation alone.  If he also bought a few lunches downtown nothing would be left for his family.  Many walk to work on shoes fashioned from canvas uppers and rubber soles.  Now canvas is scarce and a used tire costs a fortune.  If they are having it tough then imagine the plight of the poor.  What kind of help are they getting?  None — just words, words and more words.</p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
