Nine other officers surrender after ... mopping up drive in Visayan district."  The nine are unnamed, but Lt. Col. Luis G. Jakosalem, the dentist son of a wealthy Cebu family, surrendered after being wounded on May 10.  He had to make the appropriate statements of remorse and gratitude, but he was either captured, or he surrendered to get medical attention.</p>								<p>A new Supreme Commander of the Army in the Philippines just arrived.  General Shigenori Kuroda succeeds Tanaka, who was relieved and "transferred to another important post."  A picture shows Tanaka wasn't in the airport receiving party.  Homma received Tanaka — why is Tanaka not receiving Kuroda?</p>								<p>Fermin Caram is in Manila.  He was on the road with three high-ranking Japanese officials to inspect the Antique mines when guerrillas ambushed them.  Caram lay down flat in the car and was the only survivor.  Now he's here pending a Japanese investigation of the event.</p>								<p>On January 14, Caram sent a letter to Confesor asking him to surrender for the peace and tranquility of the nation.  General Quimbo, Senator Veloso and Captain Tando co-signed the letter, which probably reached Confesor in late February.  I have in my hand an undated official copy of Confesor's reply to Caram — excerpts below.  No comment is necessary:</p>								<blockquote>This is a total war in which the issues between the warring parties are less concerned with territorial questions but more with forms of government, ways of life, and those that affect even the very thoughts, feelings and sentiments of every man....  As long ... as America and Japan remain at war, these fundamental questions will remain unsettled.  Consequently, peace and tranquility will not reign in Panay, much less the whole Philippines.</blockquote>								<blockquote>However, there is a means to bring about peace even under the present circumstances if Japan is really sincere in her desire to see peace and tranquility.  To this effect, she should declare the Philippines free and independent proclaiming at the same time our neutrality....  She should evacuate all her forces, military establishments and other governmental organizations from the islands with the guarantee that she would not land forces therein nor within her territorial waters.  I am sure that should Japan declare this proposition and formally present the same to the United States, the latter would be compelled to accept it....</blockquote>								<blockquote>Let me tell you frankly that we will never be independent under such conditions because they are impossible of accomplishment for at least a century.  I entirely disagree with Mr. Vargas when he states that the Japanese independence proposition is definite and clear while that of America is ambiguous.  On the contrary, it is that of the Japanese which is nebulous, vague and indefinite.  The terms and conditions in this regard are phrased in such manner that only puppets could understand them clearly, people who have no freedom to use their will and other mental faculties.</blockquote>								<blockquote>The burden of your so called message to me consists of the entreaty that further bloodshed and destruction of property in Panay should stop and that our people be saved from further sufferings and miseries resulting from warfare and hostilities now going on between Japan and ourselves. The responsibility, however, does not rest upon us but entirely upon your friends who have sworn allegiance to Japan, for it was Japan that projected and created those conditions.  Japan is the sole author of this holocaust in the Far East.</blockquote>								<blockquote>You were a member of the Constitutional Convention that adopted the Constitution of the Philippines Commonwealth.  You did not only subscribe to it but you also became a Filipino citizen by virtue thereof.  Now that the hour of test has come, how dare you advise the people ... to forsake that sacred document and accept anything for peace and tranquility, which ... will be only temporary?</blockquote>								<blockquote>You puppets love ease and comfort so much as to compel you to barter the liberties of our people for anything.  You underrate the nobility and grandeur of the character and soul of the Filipinos by such action.</blockquote>								<blockquote>I wish to thank you for reminding me what General Bell wrote to Mabini, that 'only the possibility of success is the sole justification of war and as soon as that possibility disappears, civilization demands that for the sake of humanity, the vanquished should submit to the victors'....  You make the affirmation thereby that there is no 'possibility of success'....  You people who have surrendered to the Japanese ... are ignorant of what is going on....  Japan is digging her grave deeper and deeper everyday in New Guinea.  In China and in Burma she is on the run....  In Europe, Germany is in flight pursued by the Russians.  In Africa, Tripoli and Tunisia have fallen into the hands of the Allies.  Everyday, the cities of Italy are being bombed and smashed to pieces.  The Italians will soon demand a separate peace.  By June next, the Philippines will be redeemed from Japan, definitely.</blockquote>								<blockquote>I hope I have made myself clear enough to make you understand my position.  I will not surrender as long as I stand on my feet.</blockquote>								<p>The first page of the letter is written on stationery saying "United States of America, Commonwealth of the Philippines, Office of the Governor, Panay."  An insignia of "The Hunters, ROTC" showing a man with a bow and arrow is stamped on pages 1 and 5.  Page 6 is full of war news and titled: "The Press of Freedom" — published by the Hunters.  Page 7 is called, "Tid Bits," including the motto of The Hunters: Dulce et decorum est propatria mori [It is sweet and honorable to die for one's country].  A quote from President Roosevelt says, "We would rather die on our feet than live on our knees."  The rest of the page is full of jokes on cooperation, co-prosperity and similar themes.</p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
