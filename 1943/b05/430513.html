				<p class="first">I checked into <a href="../../mapper/sanmig.html">St. Joseph's Hospital</a> last night for a hernia operation.  The operation lasted 90 minutes under local anesthesia, as the doctors were more confident of its quality.  Due to a lack of space, I ended up on a sagging bed in the Nursery Room — the hottest room there — and the first two days were exceptionally hot until a late thunderstorm struck.  I suffered more from the room, the heat and the bed than the operation and its after-effects.  I got a private room on the fifth day, and was finally released on May 25.</p>
				
				<p>The doc estimated I had the hernia for at least six years, notwithstanding the fact that I've played 300 softball games in that period and biked at least 15,000 kilometers in the last 15 months.  He says I'll make a complete recovery.</p>
				
				<p>A few Americans were at the hospital: Hoskins and Stewart are hoping to stay in for the duration; Mrs. Mitland and Mrs. Nash, (hubby Ralph spent 30 days in the Santo Tomas jail) gave birth while I was there, and Mrs. Gottermann was due when I left.  Ralph wanted to name his baby "Kerry" after his father.  Mrs. Nash said that if it's a boy, she might name him <i>Harry Kerry</i> Nash.</p>
				
				<p>Most hospitals are experiencing shortages of many items, from linen to refined alcohol and soap.  There's enough gauze and tape to last the war, but anesthesia could run out in a few months.  Hospitals are also having difficulties providing a balanced diet.  Patients supplement it with outside purchases.</p>
				
				<p>Tribune: "Minister Aoki and Laurel meet again after 23 years" — they were once on the same boat returning from London.  They're still in the same boat.</p>
