Reports have it that the Constitution is ready but the Commission refuses to sign.  One report says that they don't want to declare war on the U.S. and Britain, though the Japanese are insisting on it.  Some say Laurel is against the declaration of war; most say Roxas is behind the revolt.</p>								<p>Another report says the Japanese also insisted on Conscription — two million soldiers!  This explains the big effort to train people in the provinces by coercion or subterfuge.  Naturally, the Commission is dead-set against it.</p>								<p>The best story is that the Commission wants the Japanese to stick to their promise of unconditional and complete independence, and for the Philippines to declare itself neutral and negotiate immediately with the Americans.  The Japanese supposedly replied: "You're crazy ... if you're independent you have to defend your territory, don't you?"</p>								<p>The response was that there would be no danger of invasion if the Japanese agreed to leave.</p>								<p>They were then accused of not wanting to be in the Co-Prosperity Sphere.  "Not at all, we would be glad to cooperate economically."</p>								<p>Apparently there is some backbone to the Executive Commission, though as a military communiqué would put it, their position is untenable.  It occurs to me now that all the squibs in the press (Splashes, Our Tomorrow) and Editorials on Independence were not only meant for the general public but for the Executive Commission as well.</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
