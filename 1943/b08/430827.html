MPs and Constabulary were all over the place making a nuisance of themselves.  They stopped vehicles and searched occupants in the usual haphazard manner.</p>								<p>I was already in a bad mood because I had slipped on a banana peel and hurt my operation scar.  Coming home on the last bus we were stopped and this time really searched.  A Constabulary man laid a huge paw on my scar — jolting the both of us.  In the comedic scene that followed as we lined up to re-board the bus one confused passenger walked with his hands still on his head.  Everyone laughed and I was in stitches — painful ones.  Then a group from a carretela joined our line by mistake and we laughed again.  Barely a kilometer away we were stopped and searched again, only this time by a vicious Japanese MP who handled everyone roughly.  Since this was near home I pointed in the direction I wished to go, but he shook his head and indicated that I should follow the crowd.  As I did my crepe-soled shoes slipped on the wet gutter and down I went for another jolt.</p>								<p>All frustrated now I took a chance and walked across the street to buy an avocado to take home.  It cost me a whole peso but at least it was fresh.  Approaching home it struck me that the black avocado looked like a pistol in my hand.  I looked up to see a Constabulary man glaring and beginning to level his rifle.  I should have been scared but it was all too ludicrous.  Grinning, I held the avocado up for him to see.</p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
