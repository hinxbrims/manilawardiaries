We'll be asked to fight for our independence instead, like Burma.  Listen to Burmese Head of State Ba Maw: "We follow the iron rule that if defense in its wide sense is to be made secure, the offensive is the best means of defense."  Incidentally, Ba Maw's son is in Japan — as are the sons of other prominent puppets.</p>								<p>"Burma Government Recognized" — by Japanese puppet governments.  Addressing Filipinos concerned that theirs would only be a puppet government, Our Tomorrow asks if that would not be better than "a refugee puppet government somewhere in Washington or New York?"

He has enough troubles trying to make ends meet.  Cocheros are asking to double prices, and they'll get it because transportation has become scarce.  The cost of everything is way up.  Even prices of bananas, peanuts and coconuts have jumped, while sugar is almost impossible to find in this of all countries.</p>								<p>The Astoria has to pay P6.50 for a tin of evaporated milk today.  There are no canned goods in Manila under two years of age, and some are four years old.  Thankfully, we've only had a few mild cases of food poisoning.  Our Carnation Evaporated Milk is actually richer with a layer of thick cream on the top, and our condensed milk has darkened and sweetened a bit.</p>								<p></p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
