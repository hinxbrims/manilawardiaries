He's even received threatening letters from guerrilleros.  Now he only has to face the threats of the Japanese who are forcing him to continue broadcasting, despite the fact that it is boomeranging against them.  They say the strain of performing this unholy task is wearing him to shreds.  Tonight's broadcast was particularly good, thanks to a big dose of Japanese gullibility.  They wanted him to turn FDR's August 13th speech into anti-American propaganda.  Javier began tonight with:</p>								<blockquote>President Franklin D. Roosevelt, on August 13th, commemorating the 45th anniversary of Occupation Day in the Philippines, broadcast a message to the Filipino people, promising them full independence the moment, and I quote: 'the power of our Japanese enemies is destroyed' unquote.  President Roosevelt further stated that, and I quote again: 'you will soon be redeemed from the Japanese yoke and you will be assisted in the full repair of the ravages caused by the war,' unquote.</blockquote>								<p>A moment later he quoted FDR's December 28, 1941 speech, the one where he said our freedom would be "redeemed."  From then on, he had to quote Gen. Aguinaldo on how the Americans double-crossed him, which is what the Japanese were building up to, but the damage was already done.  Even before Javier stopped speaking, the effect of the words <i>soon</i>, <i>reconstruction</i> and <i>protection</i> electrified listeners.</p>								<p>Javier then moved on to war news, and managed to tell us about the bombing of Rome, Milan and Berlin, the Sicilian front news, and a bit of Russian news.  He was giving us the Allies' side of the news, and the sheer audacity of it seemed to leave him short of breath.  He closed with: "And so, we leave you until next Monday, when, God willing, we shall be back with you again.  Good night."  The last words came out in a heavy sigh.  It was obvious he was under a terrific strain, matching wits with the Japanese in a game in which the odds were heavily stacked against him.</p>								<p></p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
