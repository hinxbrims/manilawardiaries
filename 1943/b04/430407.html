We're wondering why.</p>								<p>A prewar Japanese civilian, now with the Japanese Military Police, came into the Astoria today.  Recognizing Tony Morales, Piñol and I, he said girlishly: "Ah ha!  I saw you, I saw you, I saw you!" — meaning I recognize you guys, brokers, eh?  Brother, we recognized you too, and we noticed you replaced another Japanese agent in coming to the Astoria.</p>								<p>An unconfirmed story says Laurel proposed that members of the Executive Commission pass a resolution requesting the Japanese to allow the Filipino Flag to be flown alongside the Japanese Flag.  They voted it down.  An unnamed member insinuated that it wouldn't do at all — he really liked the Filipino flag — hence didn't want it flown in these times, either with or without the Japanese flag. </p>								<p>All the tables were taken at the <a href="../../mapper/admin_district.html">Jai-Alai</a> Keg Room, so Salsamendi, a pro-Fascist and the No.1 pelotari in the Orient, ordered a waiter to set a place for him at a table of friends, as is the Spanish custom here.  At the table were a couple of strangers.  The conversation drifted and Salsamendi started berating the Americans for scurrying out of the Philippines.  One of the strangers turned out to be Col. Manzano — a little old guy with 22 years in the USAFFE and a leading engineer who was responsible for some of the Bataan fortifications.  The tough old-timer got up, walked over to the pelotari's chair, and gave him a divinely inspired lecture juicily tempered in vitriolics and dripping with indignation.  Only it was in Spanish and it loses much of its flavor in the retelling and more in the translation.  Everyone froze then looked around nervously; hoping Manzano wouldn't attract attention.  They couldn't stop him but he got away with it anyway.  Salsamendi sat through the entire verbal assault in silence, his face white with embarrassment.  Later, he tried to apologize.</p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
