That explains the hospital ships.</p>								<p>"P.I. Assured of Cotton Goods Supply at Controlled Prices ... Army to control sale ... Maximum retail prices will be fixed shortly to check activities of cloth profiteers."  And the supply should vanish <i>pronto</i>.</p>								<p>The group of 14 reported to have been executed last October weren't shot but given 15 years of hard labor, and they're actually free, except for Cowper who died in Muntinglupa of a gum infection.</p>								<p>Father Theo was all set to leave for Cabanatuan yesterday with a 2-1/2 ton truck with P5,000 worth of medicines, plus shoes, clothes, food and individual packages; but he needed 50 liters of alcohol.  With Menzi and Co. short because of heavy Primco deliveries, I asked Pirovano to get some from Juan Elizalde.  Manolo and I collected it with Schaer's truck, delivered it to the Padre, and off he went.  I hope Joe gets my two big packages.  I also gave Amusategui P50 for Joe yesterday.</p>								<p>Found Hans Menzi in good spirits and improving health.  He explained his limp was due to a growth on his spine from beatings.  One member of his group apparently died of the water treatment and his body was thrown into their cell.  Hans isn't altogether bitter and doesn't presume to judge the Japanese.  "I just can't understand them," he said.  He got treated well before his release, and when he went back to pay his respects, he was treated with the utmost courtesy â€” the Japanese who beat him up the worst sent him tea, food and flowers in Bilibid.  (Menzi and Co. supplies the Japanese with many products including rubber.)  Hans credits Col. Nagahama for humanizing Fort Santiago and getting rid of the old torturers.</p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
