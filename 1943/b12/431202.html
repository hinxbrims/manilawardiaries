He's mad at Stimson too for claiming that only five carrier planes were lost in the Gilberts.  Commentator says that an earlier Rabaul raid, which claimed four Japanese destroyers, could not have been made without opposition from Japanese planes.  "Impossible," he says, completely overlooking Japanese claims of sinking aircraft carriers galore without any apparent opposition from American planes.
