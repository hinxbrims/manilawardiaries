Two will tour the provinces to contact "misguided bands."</p>								<p>"Army air units destroy 84 foe planes" — after ten days of bombing our airbases in "Hengyang, Lingling, Wuchow and Shaokwan."</p>								<p>Maharajah is back on duty.  He was in Japan so he's probably Icasiano or Bautista.  He says, "coffee costs 10 sen," and a meal in an ordinary restaurant, "not more than a yen (one peso)."  He forgot to add that "points" are required.</p>								<p>Now it's forbidden to bring <i>palay</i><sup>†</sup> and corn into the city.  The price of palay was raised to P8 a sack — still too little and too late as the planting is over.  La Vanguardia says fruits and vegetables are next on the regulators' list.

That's the first time I've heard of a war ration that people are forced to buy.</p>								<p class="footnote"><br><sup>†</sup> Unhusked rice.</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
