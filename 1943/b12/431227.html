The prohibition is lifted" — temporarily — pending formation of a new NARIC and until regular distribution of rice can begin again.  It's an emergency all right — a complete disaster for the government, Naric, and the Japanese.  Naric has no rice.  Neither the government nor all the resources of the great Japanese Empire could transport it 100 kilometers from Pampanga to Manila, yet two weeks ago they shut the gate and confiscated even small parcels of rice.  The government had to throw in the towel and open community kitchens to feed the poor.</p>								<p>Before the war we were practically self-sufficient in rice though we imported vast amounts of flour, canned goods and fresh fruit (at incredibly low prices, we now know).  With imports out, we leaned more heavily on rice.  With the Japanese here consuming as much rice as 15% of our population, a shortage was inevitable.  The Japanese masterminded this chaos with their false victories, false pledges and false predictions of bumper crops everywhere that never materialized.  The famous Horai rice experiment was a complete failure.  The words "Greater-East-Asia and Co-prosperity Sphere" make a mockery of the times.  What the average Filipino thinks of the Japanese and their government is unprintable.</p>								<p>This afternoon there were riots at some local bakeries.  With rice rations suspended, people looking for substitutes stormed the bakeries.  They closed early — "Sold Out" — the signs said.</p>								<p>What's News?
