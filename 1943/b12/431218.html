Bautista completed his short series — "A Month in Japan," and Icasiano starts his' — "Japan in Perspective."  His second article said people willingly stand in line practically everywhere for refreshments and other commodities, "but they still have plenty of food."  So why the lines?</p>								<p>At Lina's Little Inn in Ermita last night, a Greek engineer threw caution to the wind and got blind-drunk celebrating the New Britain landings.  He blessed America and cursed the Japanese at the top of his voice, despite constant admonitions of the proprietor that the room next door was full of Japanese.  "<i>Hip-hip hooray!  The Yanks are comin' back....  Bring on the Japs!  Roll out the ... bastards, we'll have a barrel of fun!</i>" he bellowed, and kept up a tirade for hours.  Eventually, he mercifully passed out.  The proprietor mopped his brow.  The pianist wrung his hands to ease the pain in his fingers.  The cash register jingled.  The Glorious Greek slept.  On the other side of the partition, the Japanese partied on.  Fifteen hundred miles away the Yanks were coming.  At this rate, our expectant wooer won't last long enough to see them.</p>								<p>Speaking of wisecracks, a Japanese guard touring the rooms in Santo Tomas came across an empty space:</p>								<p class="dialogB">"Who belongs here?" he inquired.</p>								<p class="dialogA">"Uncle Sam."</p>								<p class="dialogB">"Where is he?"</p>								<p class="dialogA">"He's coming.  He'll be here very soon now."</p>								<p class="dialogB">"Good," said the guard officiously, moving on before the boys lost control.</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
