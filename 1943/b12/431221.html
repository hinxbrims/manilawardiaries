They say the plane even strafed the lifeboats.</p>								<p>"Naval Garrison in Gilberts makes Gallant Charge on Enemy ...  4,500 fight to last man in Defense of Makin and Tarawa against numerically superior Enemy Forces."  What's startling is that this took place on November 25, barely five days after the landing.  The Editorial tried to rewrite history by comparing it to Corregidor: "The Americans had adequate ammunition and more than sufficient foodstuffs on that Island to resist for months but they threw up their hands in three days."</p>								<p>At a Medical Confab, several Filipino doctors were startled to find Japanese doctors and priests wearing swords.  A certain gent invited three to dinner at his house, and one doctor arrived wearing a very rare and ornamental sword.  The impressed but curious host just had to ask, <i>"But do doctors carry swords?"</i></p>								<p>In answer, the doctor unsheathed the sword, swished it left and right, straightened up and said: "<i>You know, with this sword I have killed 28 Chinese.</i>"  A second later, sensing the startled expression of his host, he added: "<i>Er, sometimes one has to ... you know?</i>"</p>								<p>At the Philippine General Hospital, gauze is reused after being washed and sterilized.  Not so at the Japanese Military Hospital in Fort McKinley, where people wipe their faces with it then throw it away.  It's a paradise where food and commodities are abundant.  Patients get three square meals, a pint of milk, a large bowl of ice cream and fruit, and desert in the afternoon.  They get soap — laundry soap, Palmolive, Japanese toilet soap — more than twenty times our monthly ration.  They get cigarettes — two packs a day.  I didn't believe it until a friend checked out from there carrying an incredible quantity of loot.  He gained seven pounds in the month he was there.</p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
