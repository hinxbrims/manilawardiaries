The trip wasn't a success except for thrills.  The Japanese would've jailed Maurice, Manny and a driver if not for the intervention of the Chief of Police, who the boys had thoughtfully given 2-1/2 yards of Khaki and a bottle of Rum earlier.  Manny did spend a few hours in jail.</p>								<p>Three times they went to Aroroy, once staying only a half-day as the Japanese were rounding up all transients in a fit of fury.  On one trip, a batel-master tried to turn Maurice and Manny over to some bandits.  He reconsidered when the boys threatened to throw him overboard.</p>								<p>In the river between Pilar and Putiao in Sorsogon Province, four Constabulary men in a banca were hailed from a bush and told to put their hands up.  Guerrillas took their rifles and 160 bullets.  It became the joke of both towns.  The Constabulary men reported that they had been held up by a band of 90 armed bandits.  The 15 Japanese garrisoned in each town could do nothing.  The Japanese once sent a Constabulary company to the hills to chase guerrilleros away from the railroad tracks — they joined the guerrillas instead.</p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
