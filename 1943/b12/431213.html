It's a low blow because the people were allowed to bring six gantas<sup>†</sup> each and the regulations were changed without notice.</p>								<p>For a week now, Santo Tomas internees haven't been allowed to receive rice, lard, sugar and coffee from friends outside.  The thinking is that the food must have been bought from the black market.  So Santo Tomas is down to rations only.  Kato is keeping quiet.  When he first arrived, he expressed surprise that families were separated and visitors forbidden.  He said that Santo Tomas was the worst internee camp he had yet seen, and aimed to fix that, but the Military Police have throttled him.  Not all internees buy that story.  "Military Police or no Military Police," said one of them, "a Jap is a Jap."</p>								<p>As for news, everyone's distressed at the lack of it.  Pravda predicted a new Soviet offensive; Japan struck American airbases in China after Tojo warned they posed a threat to Japan; and six days after the Japanese occupied Changteh, the Chinese drove them out and back about 30 miles.</p>								<p class="footnote"><br><br><br><sup>† </sup> About 1.5 ~ 2 Kgs of rice.</p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
