And Minister Bonifacio is the goat.</p>								<p>Those in the know are impressed with the Red Cross packages.  Each item is packaged in small tins so you can open one and save the rest for later.  Imagine an internee family of seven getting 28 pounds of Klim milk.  Stale Klim is worth P75 a pound on the outside.  My guess is a whole case with four rations would be worth about P1,500; but there's a cost to the internees: all rations have been cut off!  Even Kato made a speech last night advising them to put some canned goods away for a rainy day.  The Japanese were quite mean in distributing the IRC packages.  Many tins were ripped open with callousness bordering on childish petulance to check for contraband — nothing was found.  It was worse in Bilibid than Santo Tomas.</p>								<p>A highly intelligent and respectable Filipina is running a letter-carrying service using a Japanese Colonel <i>and</i> his Japanese driver — both.  Her husband, Schneider, wasn't imprisoned in Cabanatuan but forced to work elsewhere, so she hadn't heard from him for almost 1-1/2 years.  After finding his whereabouts, she went to the town and parked herself in one of the market stalls disguised as a vendor.  Three weeks later, the Colonel brought the husband to her stall.  I'm told that all they did was shake hands; tears welled up in the husband's eyes — not hers.  There must have been worlds in that handshake.</p>								<p></p>								<p></p>								<blockquote></blockquote>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
