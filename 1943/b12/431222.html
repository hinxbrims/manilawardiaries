Even our chickens refused to eat it!  (We might trick them by mixing it with palay.)  Schaer thinks his hogs might eat it.  A friend who tried to cook it said it refused to soften and expand, and might be "petrified."  I intend to preserve some for posterity to prove I'm not exaggerating.  Fortunately we have a small stash of <i>real</i> rice — but what about those who haven't?</p>								<p>"All I want for Christmas is a good bombing," said a lady to me this morning while waiting for a streetcar.  People sharing the same wish will be disappointed.  A friend said in church that he would walk out if the priest followed Bonifacio's directive.  "Don't be silly," said another, "I have yet to meet a pro-Japanese priest in Manila."</p>								<p>What's news?  Plenty — all over the place, and good too, but progress is slow.  Berlin is said to be 40% destroyed.  Bremen got 1,200 tons of bombs.  Incidentally Captain Jimmy Stewart was in the lead plane over Bremen — his second trip.</p>								<p></p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
