By then the sheer scale of the enterprise had made the task too difficult, and the feel of the original work was lost.</p>								<p>The mission having fallen to me, I kept returning to the original typed transcripts of his notebooks, where magic could be found in the stories of people, tragedy, high irony, humor and relief, plus the occasional rant. In short, I started from scratch, retaining threads I found historically fascinating in the expectation that You — dear reader — might find them fascinating too. It was an exhausting and rewarding journey of a many years, involving much research, hunting down transcription errors, and learning about Manila by making my own map.</p>												<p>Fortunately, bringing a work of well over a million words down by 78% involved mostly cutting press reports and war news that you can find in online archives of Manila newspapers, except important contextual background and what dominated discussions at the time.  It's still too big for a book but fine for a website, where maps and images could help retain reader interest, and where an index for search engines could aid researchers.  The work is still long. How could it be short and yet remain faithful to the original?</p>								<p>To paraphrase Henry L. Stimson, history is often not what actually happened but what is recorded as having happened. This is but one such recording.</p>								<p>I'm sure my father would like to have dedicated this to his brother, Joseph Brimo — a survivor of the Bataan Death March and the Oryoku Maru sinking.</p>								<p><br>Henry A.
