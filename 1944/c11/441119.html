Minister Sison instructs Governors to warn people against all Acts of Treason Endangering State Security."  As Chief Delegate of the President and Inspector General of Martial Law, he listed the following activities as breaking the law:</p>								<ul>				<li>Spreading of false information against the Republic;</li>								<li>Willful obstruction of Government activities;</li>								<li>Destruction by explosion, discharge of electrical current, inundation, sinking or damaging a vessel ... taking rails from a railroad track, maliciously changing railway signals, destroying telegraph posts ... and other acts of sabotage;</li>								<li>Arson;</li>								<li>Sheltering and protection of enemy airmen;</li>								<li>Harboring enemy spies;</li>								<li>Giving any form of aid, material or otherwise, to the enemy and to other elements hostile to the Republic;</li>								<li>Communicating with the enemy by any means whatsoever;</li>								<li>Listening to radio broadcasts from the enemy and spreading the same to the people as propaganda against the Republic.</li>				</ul>								<p>"Whereabouts of Admiral Mitscher of U.S. 58th Task Force mystery."  The Japanese would like to see him and his Task Force, "if it is still in existence."</p>								<p><b>AIR RAIDS</b>: It started in the dark just before <b>0600</b> (0500 standard time).  The Americans dropped three large bombs on the southern airfields, after which the siren sounded.  We're still under air raid conditions at <i>1400</i>.  The raids have been small and scattered though persistent: about 20 planes in one or two waves every hour except during lunch, concentrating mostly on the Bay with some attention given to the airfields and Port Area.</p>								<p>After the last wave at around <b>1400</b>, a few planes returned for targets of opportunity â€” the last ones arriving at <b>1915</b>, a few minutes after which the Japanese lifted the air raid signal.  By nightfall we heard reports that four or five ships in the North Harbor had been sunk.  Japanese planes have been conspicuously absent all day and for the first time in the early evening too.  A coming new moon promises some night bombing.  The Japanese have been trucking military supplies and equipment downtown yesterday and this morning.  A much-overworked steamroller heading toward Nichols was in such poor condition that it got stuck climbing the elevated railroad crossing at Santa Mesa.</p>								<p>Manilans are starting to feel desperate at the news that the Americans expect a tough and protracted campaign.  They give you a look of incredulity when you tell them that Ormoc has yet to fall.</p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
