One of the Ossorios recently rented a used pushcart for one day <em>sans</em> personnel for P2,500.  A friend recently bought an automobile for P40,000 then sold the used tires for P45,000.  Another friend recently turned down a P15,000 offer for his bike because he wanted P20,000.  Soon after he was held up in broad daylight and robbed of his bike, a new P1,000 shirt and some cash.</p>								<p>Coming from San Juan to <a href="../../_maps/sanjuan.html">Valenzuela</a> on the long isolated stretch after the San Juan Bridge, on either side of which rice is growing, is a little pond.  The poorest of people have been known to spend a considerable time fishing there for a minnow or two for supper.  Recently, two Japanese officers and 40 men jumped off their truck, bailed the water out and grabbed all the fishes.</p>								<p>Yes, the Japanese are more than hungry.  Anyone taking food home in a bayong always feels uneasy passing Japanese sentries.  For the most part though, the Japanese take only what their 8-10-man garrison needs for just one or two meals.  They get plenty of rice but not much else.  The friendly Sergeant near Maurice recently traded a ganta of rice for some of Maurice's eggs.  The rice was worth P300 and the eggs only P165 so Maurice was pleased.  After a few trades, the Sergeant started sending Maurice two pails of garbage a day for chicken feed.  The pails are full of uneaten rice fit for human consumption.  You should see Maurice's chickens now!</p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
