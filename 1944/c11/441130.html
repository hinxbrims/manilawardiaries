The Japanese Air Force has been very active last night and early this morning.  They've perfected a system of hiding planes on the ground that is a challenge to American reconnaissance.

There were 13 ships all told: 3 large cargo-transports, 4 medium and 3 small troop transports escorted by 3 destroyers.  MacArthur estimated the Japanese lost 4,000 men.  He mentioned that 23-1/2 inches of rain have fallen in Leyte so far this month, a record for November.</p>								<p>R.I.P. Dionisio "Chito" Calvo<sup>†</sup>, about a week ago in Fort Santiago.
