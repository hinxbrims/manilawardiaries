Later they added that 300 carrier planes raided Luzon.</p>								<p>The <i>Alert</i> sounded at <b>0815</b> despite the light rains.  The barometer had climbed by <b>0915</b>, and the sun started to peep through the rain.  I stayed at home to "protect" the house while Dad went to town.</p>								<p>A trusted eyewitness atop an apartment building overlooking the Bay reported that four Japanese warships went down in last Sunday's raid.  He could scarcely believe his eyes when a destroyer took a direct hit amidships, split into two, and went down in seconds.  "<i>If the pilot had looked back after his climb-out, he would have missed it</i>," he said.  A brand-new light cruiser weaving in and out apparently escaped unscathed except for shrapnel from the near misses.  Another witness who said that the ships were below his line of sight counted six fires, "<i>definitely</i>."  A Nimitz communiqué confirmed that six ships were hit; 191 planes were destroyed — 100 on the ground and the rest mostly over Clark.  I believe this is only for Sunday.</p>								<p>Tribune: "4 More U.S. Carriers Blasted."  Daihon-ei said a kamikaze attack on a Task Force east of the P.I. sank a carrier and heavily damaged another.  A sub sank another carrier on the night of November 3.  The box score is now 356, including 53 carriers, 16 battleships and 30 cruisers.</p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
