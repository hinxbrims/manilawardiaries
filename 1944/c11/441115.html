Dr. Luis Guerrero Jr. decided to go along on the third trip; the house collapsed on him.</p>								<p>The family of the drugstore owner had evacuated, leaving the contents of the store behind as it was too difficult to move.  The store is gone now, as reported in La Vanguardia, but the number of bombs dropped there thoroughly burned to a crisp some ten Japanese trucks parked under nearby trees.  An eyewitness at the Elena Apartments said the plane was hit and the pilot released his bombs just before crashing.</p>								<p style="text-align: right" class="inLink"><br><a href="441115b.html"> continues...</a></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
