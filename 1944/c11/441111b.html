Unimpressed spectators cracked jokes.</p>								<p>"<i>We always have a great time during the raids, dashing from window to window</i>," said Fito Garcia, talking about a couple of bombs that landed near him in Paco.  So what did he do when the two bombs dropped?  "<i>Pues chico, we dove in all directions.  We were flat on our faces in the blink of an eye.  Listen, an SB2C can take diving lessons from me!</i>"</p>								<p>Leyte News: The Japanese landed additional "heavy reinforcements" and paid a price for it.  They used 4 transports escorted by 15 destroyers and supported by planes.  The American Fifth Airforce in Leyte went "all-out" in a continuous 24-hour effort, sinking 3 transports and 6 destroyers.  A Seventh Fleet PT boat sank a seventh destroyer off Mindoro.  So many Japanese are confined to such a small area in Leyte that they will have to attempt a breakthrough somewhere — probably tonight.</p>								<p>A correspondent told the tale of an American doughboy who plucked a fruit in Leyte, and by pantomime, asked a little native boy if it was good to eat.  The kid didn't understand, so he repeated the act several times but got no response.  Finally a bystander told the kid in English: "<em>What he wants to know is if it's all right to eat that fruit</em>."</p>								<p>"<i>Hell yes</i>," answered the kid, "<i>it's got Vitamin B!"</i></p>								<p class="center">...ooOoo...</p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
