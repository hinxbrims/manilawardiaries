The airmen gave Corregidor its first taste of American bombs, blanketing the whole island with large fires at one time.  A Japanese tanker left ablaze yesterday is still burning today.  One Japanese plane was shot down on the North Manila side, its insignia plainly visible.  I saw one plane get shot down south of Parañaque at around 0800 yesterday.  Many Manilans have been climbing up the Michel, Rosario, Elena Apartments, or the Insular Life and Wilson Buildings to have a look at the graveyard of sunken ships that is Manila Bay.</p>								<p>A friend living by Nichols described the early morning raids: One large plane comes over, flashes a searchlight on the field, then two planes following right behind drop a large bomb each.  The raid is timed to catch the Japanese as they prepare for takeoff on their early morning flights.</p>								<p>The press insists that the Japanese are outwitting the Americans by hiding their planes at specially camouflaged fields in Angeles and San Mateo.  They know the Americans are reluctant to hit civilian areas.  Yesterday, the Japanese parked a couple of planes on <a href="../../mapper/pasay.html">F.B. Harrison</a>, endangering nearby residents.</p>								<p>The Japanese are also taking over the Regina and Arias Buildings (no doubt there'll be more) to store machinery, munitions and supplies in areas considered safer.  A report from Figueras says they will move Fort Santiago away from danger — right into the Padre Burgos School behind our garden!</p>								<p><b>LEYTE</b>: After one month of fighting, MacArthur says Japanese casualties have passed the 45,000 mark, while U.S. casualties were 5,691.  Yesterday, the Japanese tried but failed to break out of the Limon pocket.  There were sharp clashes all along the front with the Japanese slugging it out desperately, and for the most part on that day, successfully.</p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
