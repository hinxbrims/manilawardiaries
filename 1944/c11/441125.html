A total of 7 big bombs were dropped on the airfields in the first 15 minutes.  I couldn't see the planes but I could hear them â€” not any antiaircraft.  At <b>0812</b>, a shiny-aluminum plane flying in a group of seven got hit and went into a tailspin.  I doubt if the pilot knew what hit him.</p>								<p>A second wave arrived at <b>0815</b>.  I counted 26 planes, mostly in pairs, crisscrossing directly overhead and heading for the Bay and Port Area.  Once again, the pom-poms of Japanese warships started chanting madly.  I was looking out of Joe's window when the concussion of a large bomb at Nielson blew me back a foot!  It felt like the heaviest bomb yet.</p>								<p>After a moment of quiet at <b>0826</b>, antiaircraft opened up again against an approaching flight of 50 or so planes....  This third wave is a scattered but persistent affair.  There's a wave over the Bay now ... I hear enough of a roar to guess about 20 to 30 motors.</p>								<p>During a lull, I ducked into the shower and missed a flight of planes that overflew us at low altitude.  I finished in time to see three planes strafe Nichols.  I went to Maurice's at <b>1030</b> and watched a rather dull raid.  Perhaps 150 planes all told showed up over Manila today.  The Grace Park airfield on the north side of Manila got a going-over.  I didn't see any Japanese planes but heard their motors warming up at Camp Murphy at <b>1730</b>.</p>								<p>Radio Tokyo reported that a raid of about 70 B-29s on that city a little after noon resulted in "<i>negligible damage</i>," apart from "<i>a few fires</i>" that were rapidly put out.  The 2-1/2 hour bombing was from "<i>an extremely high altitude of 9,000 to 10,000 meters.</i>"  Daihon-ei in the Tribune claimed three B-29s were shot down.</p>								<p>Sison issued a circular to church officials appealing to them for cooperation and help in enforcing the laws of "<i>these crucial times</i>."</p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
