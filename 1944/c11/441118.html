The reason for the high state of alert is that there are more ships in the Bay.  Most Manilans expect further raids today or tomorrow so many are staying home.  I found only two customers at the Astoria this morning at 0930.</p>								<p>Last Sunday, the Capuchin Padres in Intramuros said their masses early, rushed through breakfast then went up their church tower to see the show that didn't come.  It came the next day, but I'm pretty sure the Padres didn't enjoy their frontline seats.  Across the street from their church is the basketball court of the Cuartel de España — the only thing left standing on that side of the street after last Monday's raids.</p>								<p>William Courtney said on the radio that the Japanese have 125 airfields in the Philippines.  I'd like to add that in addition to that, they have an equal amount of well-hidden dispersal points for aircraft.  For example, tractors immediately tow planes that land in Camp Murphy into Marikina to park them under trees.  After last Tuesday, the Japanese tried a similar approach with their ships, sending a few small ocean-going vessels into the Malabon River.</p>								<p>Yesterday MacArthur described Japanese air activity as "negligible."  No doubt the Japanese are short of bombers, but they've still got a lot of fighters.  The fact that they are over Manila, and not Leyte, only proves that they are preparing yet another attempt to land major reinforcements in Leyte.</p>								<p>There's a lull of Anti-Axis News today.  Some 3,000 Japanese appear to be cut off as the Americans close the gap around Limon in the north of Leyte.</p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
