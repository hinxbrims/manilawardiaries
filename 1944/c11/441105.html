It should have been the Air Raid signal but the Japanese were reticent to sound it &mdash; after all, there aren't supposed to be any carriers left as today's Tribune says.  So a few minutes later American planes themselves announced the air raid, after which, the Japanese reluctantly gave us the signal.</p>								<p>It was a short, snappy raid.  The Japanese would have preferred to intercept the American planes further away from Manila but they were too late.  We were treated to the spectacle of dogfights over Camp Murphy, and afterwards, pure dive-bombing over Murphy and Nichols.  The American force was strong — I'd say at least 150 planes in 20 minutes.</p>								<p>I saw my first plane shot down today over Camp Murphy.  First there was white smoke, then flames that grew into a huge ball of fire.  The craft kept going straight and level at about 5,000 feet while the fireball consumed all the fuel and went out.  Then the tail separated, the craft lost speed, wobbled, and spun down trailing a wisp of smoke.</p>								<p>Maurice called up during the raid.  Seems Figueras told old man Sotelo the Japanese Embassy was going to take our house.  Figueras was "sorry" but it was "definitely" decided.  He's chairman of the Housing Board, you see?  We haven't been told directly unless Figueras thinks Sotelo is our official representative.  We should have the support of the Manga Avenue residents and the Kempeitai, but who knows.  It's shaping up like a <i>battle royale</i> — yesterday, our office; today our home!</p>								<p>Incidentally, this is the second time Figueras and his committee has sold us down the river without any notice.  The greatest irony would be to discover that the Embassy, Figueras and the Military Police have made an agreement without our knowledge.  Today, Kunishi and a translator walked past our house toward the White House ... to talk things over?</p>								<p></p>								<p style="text-align: right" class="inLink"><br><a href="441105b.html"> continues...</a></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
