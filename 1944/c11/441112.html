Halsey's Third Fleet attacked with 150 planes, sinking two destroyers, one destroyer escort and four transports.  The remaining three destroyers were heavily damaged, two of which are considered "probably sunk."  It almost sounds like a Japanese communiqué, except it was probably only exaggerated.  The Japanese sent 20 planes and lost 13.</p>								<p>Guerrillas in Manila, organized by district, are armed and itching for action.  They believe the only chance for a quick liberation of Manila lies with them when the Americans are on the outskirts.  The risk of being fingered by a stool pigeon is greater here than in the provinces.  I've noticed that whenever someone known is "called," he disappears, probably into the mountains.  Life is tough in the city; the mountains promise freedom and comradely adventure.  Those of us with ties that bind, like my aged and weakening parents, are in an almost unenviable position.  We have to stay here through thick and thin — and we're growing thinner every day.</p>								<p>People are already talking about the post day-of-reckoning period, dissatisfied at Osmeña's appointment of Gen. Basilio Valdes (Chief of Staff of the Philippine Army) as head of the board of inquiry.  He's a wonderful man, known and loved by all, but the worry is that he may be too softhearted — full up with family ties and obligations.  Worried that some of the traitors could escape justice, guerrillas might just take matters into their own hands.  The list of names is long, and some of the men are BIG, including Madrigal — the richest Filipino by a long shot — and some of Osmeña's own sons!  There's no use in mentioning too many names, though I understand one is Dr. Moreta, the leading Spanish surgeon in the Philippines who deserves it not, but rather deserves a certain other great distinction.</p>								<p>Whenever this subject comes up, everyone examines their conscience, always finding some little thing to be guilty about.  Everyone harbors a little fear too from perhaps some misunderstanding or a grudge — if not with the guerrillas then with the Japanese.  I ask myself, what sacrifices have I undergone?  Is non-collaboration enough?  My hernia has been an obstacle, but only Maurice and Dr. Baylon know about it.  Time will tell.</p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
