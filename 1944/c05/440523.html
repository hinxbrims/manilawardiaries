Maurice had just said hello to him as he passed by our house.  A few doors down, three men pulled out their pistols and held him up.  Robberies are on the increase — for anything and everything from light bulbs to negligees inadvertently left near the bed and picked up by a pole.  And please watch your clothesline, don't leave shoes near a window, and watch out for fake inspectors — they've been known to take water meters.</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
