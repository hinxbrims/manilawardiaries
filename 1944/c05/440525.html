The Japanese have been taking houses right and left and ousting all occupants of decent apartments.  First they try suave persuasion and sometimes patience while they make up their minds if they want the house or not.  If they do, they slip you an unobtrusive (they think) notice giving you a few days (weeks if you're lucky, hours if you're not) to move out.  Just how insecure we feel can be illustrated with the following anecdote.</p>								<p>Two days ago Ma was entertaining the genial Mrs. Klingler in the porch when a big Buick parked opposite our gate.  "Voila," she exclaimed, "they're here for the house."  Spying the car as I returned home, my heart sank.  At last, I thought, the Japanese have come for me or for our house.  At the Sotelo's, a passer-by mentioned the car to Maurice, and his heart sank too.  And it was all because an expected friend arrived in a borrowed car.</p>								<p>Doc Baylon's house is in a subdivision developed by a belligerent.  He was given a reprieve some six months ago because the Japanese didn't need his house anymore and they acknowledged he had paid all but P1,200 for the house.  Recently he received a notice to pay up or lose the house.  He had no choice so went to pay.  "You can't do that," he was told.  "You must first ask the Japanese for permission, through their benevolence and magnanimity, to be allowed to pay the P1,200."  He's waiting for the answer.</p>								<p>One family that was told to vacate within 12 hours was also asked to leave the furniture and refrigerator (worth P10,000) behind in return for a payment of P500.  One Russian was smarter; he moved out quickly with his refrigerator and stove.  Picornell was kicked out of his rental home and moved to an apartment, and now they want to kick him out again.</p>								<p>Tribune: Daihon-ei says 35,000 enemy were killed in the Honan area.</p>								<p>La Vanguardia: "Rice is still selling at high prices....  Drastic measures will be taken against profiteers."  The item that's got Manila laughing: "Madrigal renounces his rice ration."  Up to now, he's been giving it to the poor.</p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
