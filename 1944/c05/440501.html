"Another U.S. airbase destroyed" — in Kiangsi, China.  "Admiral Halsey's fleet has lost its power" — so he's alive now.  "MacArthur to lead offensive" — good news.</p>								<p>"Philippine Mission in Manchukuo since yesterday" — and Aquino made another speech at the farewell banquet.  Marvelous how he keeps going while Yulo and the others stay mum.</p>								<p>Visitors to Santo Tomas found the internees thinner but in high spirits.  The half-hour visits were strictly supervised.  No packages were allowed; bags and umbrellas had to be checked-in.  Fewer restrictions applied at Los Baños where the internees seem happier.  The weather and scenery is better, and food is probably easier to come by.</p>								<p>Conchita didn't even know whether Paul was in Santo Tomas or Los Baños until she received the visit notification.  Now they will keep in visual touch: twice a week at a certain time, Paul will pace where she can see him from the balcony of a house outside the camp.  The new Santo Tomas commandant is apparently a Major in the regular army.  The internees are trying to finagle some concessions out of him.</p>								<p>The Swiss Club met to discuss what to do in case of heavy bombings or forced evacuations.  Should they leave the city or stick it out?
