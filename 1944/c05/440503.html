British subs sank another 5.</p>								<p>A report says Vargas still wants to resign, but will hold off temporarily on Laurel's plea.</p>								<p>The Japanese parked American-built trucks overnight near Casa Mañana in Dewey Boulevard.  By morning, all the tires and rims were gone.</p>								<p>Some months ago, four American submarines landed supplies at Mamburao, Mindoro, together with three American officers and one Filipino officer.  The Japanese captured one Lawrence Phillips.</p>								<p>A sentry hauled a man into Fort Santiago after spotting him making a V-sign at some passing POWs by scratching his eyes with two fingers.  The accused insisted that he had only been scratching his eyes.  "Henceforth, scratch one eye at a time," said the interrogator with a hateful glare.  The hapless gent was released three days later.</p>								<p>The Sulzer girl (a 12-14 year-old Swiss) was questioned because she was seen waving discreetly at some working POWs.  "I didn't wave at the prisoners at all," she said.  "I waved at a Filipina girl friend who was passing by."  The guard hailed the Filipina and asked her if she knew the Sulzer girl.  Neither had met before but the Filipina caught on quickly: "Yeah, we're good friends."</p>								<p>La Vanguardia: "Great Panic in Imphal....  Epidemics break out in the city....  Japanese advance."</p>								<p>The banter in town is about the whitewashed window in the Heacock Building, long used as an exhibition center for Japanese propaganda.  After two weeks, a Filipino working in the building scratched bits off to have a peek.  Told I shouldn't miss it, I went to have a look today.  I saw an elaborate presentation with carved black letters on a huge gold background: "IMPHAL TAKEN" — plus a map and other propaganda material.  They've been waiting three weeks to unveil it, but Imphal just won't fall.  This will soon be the joke of the town.</p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
