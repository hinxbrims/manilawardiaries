They asked for bids then turned down in indignation an offer at P280.  After all, wasn't free entry of rice allowed?  Several days later they asked again and received an offer at P300 a sack.  They decided to think it over and accepted the following day, but by then the offer had been withdrawn and the new price was P350.  Again, they refused.  Forty-eight hours later, the price is P700 and they still haven't bought despite having only one sack left in the club.</p>								<p>Tribune: "People with rice urged to give up Biba rations....  President makes appeal to nation."  The list of those giving up their rice rations include the Speaker of the National Assembly (Aquino), the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the Food Administrator, the Mayor and Assistant Mayor, and so on.  Even if all citizens with rice cooperated, there would hardly be enough saved to fill a Japanese bodega.  But what's strange is that these officials, until two days ago, could buy rice at less than the P60 ration price — P18 a sack!  What fools we are thought to be!</p>								<p>Forced labor begins — "420,000 expected to report for work in Manila today."</p>								<p>China: "Nippon Army units occupy Honan capital....  Enemy airfields in China blasted."  China is Japan's last chance.  If they can consolidate various rail routes they could drive overland into Burma and Malaya.  It's a desperate attempt but it's all they have left barring a lucky victory over the U.S. Navy.  I'm told the U.S. Navy expects Toyoda to come out and fight.</p>								<p>"We have been warning the profiteers long enough.  It is about time we surprise" — two Editorials and Maharajah take the subject on.  The sinister hand of the Japanese is also in the Public Pulse: two letters blame the disaster on the rich and the <i>capitalists</i>.</p>								<p></p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
