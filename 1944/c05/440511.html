Speculation as to why ranges from girl trouble, his arrogance, or his political activities.  Not all Indians are pro-Japanese by a long shot.  One used to have a radio and published a regular underground service.  Tipped off, he ditched the radio two weeks before the Japanese picked him up at 0200 one morning.  They found a copy of one of his "editions" on his desk, but the smooth-talker convinced them that he had found it outside his door and just picked it up out of curiosity.  "<i>Look at me</i>," he said.  "<i>Am I not an Indian?  Am I not an Oriental?  Do you expect me to love those British bastards even now?</i>"  He was released — after less than 24 hours.</p>								<p></p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
