The speedy campaign in Honan is due to the terrain being a vast plain while Imphal is "a siege in the most hazardous mountains."</p>								<blockquote>As a matter of fact, the enemy position on the Imphal front consists of a series of formidable fortifications of great depth, and their utilization of the topographical advantages is most thorough.</blockquote>								<p>Four of us played dice for a cup of coffee.  When my cousin Gabby lost, he ruefully paid, then arose to go.  Asked where he was going, he said, "To the office to raise my prices."</p>								<p>I saw Freixas sell a bottle of cologne for the clearly marked price of P32.  I stepped out for 15 minutes and returned to find the price still clearly marked: P36.  It's the same all over town.</p>								<p>Some fellow came over to Schaer and said: "They have a search warrant to search this restaurant for rice.  Can I help you?"</p>								<p>"No," snapped Schaer.  "I have no rice â€” don't serve it here.  Let them come and search."</p>								<p>Eventually, three "searchers" arrived.  One sat down pompously to present his papers while his two self-important cohorts investigated.  Both were well dressed and smoked expensive cigars that no one on a government salary alone could afford.</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
