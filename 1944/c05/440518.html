They admitted that Japanese firms have been buying rice at high prices in the provinces, because municipality and barrio chiefs "induced sellers to offer exorbitant prices" to take advantage of the Japanese.</p>								<blockquote>We take this opportunity to state that the purchases have been made in accordance with the recognition by Philippine authorities that the rice thus purchased is to be supplied to the Filipino employees of the firms.  Needless to say, the companies have bought it at a justifiable price.</blockquote>								<p>You would think that there would be an economic justification to pool their purchases with Biba, particularly as it is the custom in the provinces to <i>soak</i> the Japanese.  Anyway, how are the Japanese going to help us?  By importing rice "in large quantities from abroad."  It's a hollow promise; Saigon and Burma have none to spare.</p>								<p>Splashes: "Hoarding is not only a hostile act to the Nippon Army but a traitorous act to our own country" — notice who comes first in that sentence.  Maharajah has one suggestion: "Masticate well."  But just WHAT will the poor masticate?</p>								<p>La Vanguardia: "Truck operators agree to give their trucks three days a month to bring rice in from the provinces."</p>								<p>The U.S. Supreme Court case on whether Negroes have the right to vote is providing juicy propaganda material for the Japanese.  Racist comments by U.S. politicians have never failed to make it to the press here.</p>								<p>News: Burma — Rapidly advancing Chinese took an important airfield.  Within an hour, gliders landed engineers to repair the field.  Italy — Eighth Army cut the last road out of Cassino.  Money — deteriorating rapidly.  I'm doing well as a share broker.</p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
