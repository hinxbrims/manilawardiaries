MacArthur is quoted as saying that the coming fight would be "bloody."  The note ends with: "And thank God for the Liberation that is near at hand."</p>								<p>Forced Labor: The Match Company employees have to work one day a week at Nichols, building shelters made of earth to protect planes against shrapnel.  The Japanese expect air raids, but civilians of all nationalities will work at the airfield in daylight.</p>								<p>There are so many diametrically opposed views on the question of Japanese currency that you'd be at sea if you spent a day listening to a number of views.  Take the case of Zuellig and Company.  The two Zuellig brothers and Schulthess do not expect the U.S. government to compensate their Swiss firm for war losses.  So they are investing — depending on their wits to get them through the currency mess now and after the war.  Their opinions are contrary to that of the majority.</p>								<p>In contrast, Menzi and Company is refraining from investing in any manner; their money is all in the bank, meticulously documented.  Having refrained from speculation, and therefore not contributed to the inflation that is harming the Filipino people, they feel they will be fully entitled to what was legally theirs before the war.</p>								<p>So who is correct?  To whom did Roosevelt address his remarks when he promised to restore all property losses "<i>right down to the last carabao"</i>?</p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
