A government official blamed his own government for the crisis: "Rotten," he said, "corrupt from top to bottom."  He knows of a PC man earning P1,000 a day from bribes.  Matsuka thinks the situation is hopeless and the Filipinos will have to turn to the Japanese for help.  They might rediscover their <i>benevolence</i>, and <i>magnanimously</i> grant us free passage of rice â€” on our own railroads.</p>								<p>The Taiwan Gas Company issued a circular to ALL employees ordering them to work one day a week in military construction: the fake building going up in the great Nichols-Nielson airbase.  An eight-month pregnant girl was exempted.  A nursing mother pleaded she couldn't keep her baby without milk all day.  "<i>Baby can wait until tonight</i>," was the gruff reply.  The Swiss working for the company asked for and got a reluctant exemption to avoid compromising their neutral status.</p>								<p>Remember Winkler?  The Japanese took over his salt factory for a measly P250 a month.  He says he'll protest to the German Consulate in Tokyo.</p>								<p>It was a blue day at the Astoria this afternoon.  By 1615 they were out of ice cream, milk, cakes, and watermelon.  Only coffee and some old Australian lemonade could be served.</p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
