Our people are now dead-set against them.  Even Pio Duran, Julio Cruz and Benigno Aquino have toned down their anti-American speeches.  Everyone realizes only too well which way the wind is blowing.</p>								<p>The Japanese can't trust anyone anymore, not even the Constabulary, who'd rather join the guerrillas than fight them.  A loss of face is the only thing that keeps the Japanese from disarming them.</p>								<p>The Japanese have no choice but to remain committed to Laurel — a man twice honored by the Emperor himself — in person.  Laurel is their tiger, but they are holding on to the tiger by its tail.  Laurel is out to prove that he is no puppet or traitor.  As Laurel himself put it two days ago:</p>								<blockquote>I am pro-Filipino and that is all....  Above all, I will prove I am as much anti-Japanese as I am anti-American.  As anti, that is, as is required to be and prove that I am pro-Filipino.</blockquote>				<p>The Japanese made the mistake of giving us too much rope.  We refused to declare war and didn't rally under their new banner.  In fact, it's the opposite — every Filipino is now a potential guerrillero.  The Japanese made the mistake of lying brazenly against the Americans; taking our food while we go hungry; hobbling our radios; proclaiming victory after victory when in fact they are suffering setback after setback.</p>								<p>Laurel sees trouble ahead.  If the Japanese, unable to rely on the Constabulary, go after the guerrillas by themselves, innocent people in the provinces will suffer — hence Laurel's passionate pleas for them to give up.  But it's too late for that; Laurel was too good an actor when he played the pro-Japanese role.</p>								<p>Tribune: "Recto Heads Pacification Tour Today."  Tirona, de las Alas, Bonifacio and Laurel's son will tour the provinces.</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">			<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="710" align="left">			<tr align="center">				<td align="center" valign="top" width="55">					&nbsp;				</td>				<td align="center" valign="top" width="200">					&nbsp;				</td>				<td align="center" valign="top" width="246">				<br><span class="inLink"><a href="#p1">- Top -</a></span>				</td>								<td align="center" valign="top" width="209">					&nbsp;				</td>			</tr>		</table>	</div>	<!-- ***************** PAGE 2 ***************** --><a name="p2"></a>	<div class="header2">		&nbsp;	</div>	<div class="main2">		<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="710" align="center">			<tr align="center">				<td align="center" valign="top" width="55">					&nbsp;				</td>				<td align="left" valign="top" width="655">			<div class="inLink">| <a href="#p1">Pg.1 The Japs Are Losing It</a>| Pg.2 |</div>				<span class="date r">Supplement Pg.2</span>				<span class="date">January 21, 1944</span>				<h3>Our Store</h3>												<p class="first">"Escolta Dry-Goods Store Raided" — Dad gets it in the neck:</p>								<blockquote>Textiles valued at more than P50,000 were confiscated yesterday by members of the Economic Police in a raid on the <i>Manila-New York Dry Goods Store</i> on the Escolta, owned by A.
