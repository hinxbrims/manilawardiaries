The news only cheered Filipinos.</p>								<p>Women received much-needed items from the American Red Cross kits — from mascara and nail polish to girdles and <i>Kotex</i>.  The medicines alone are supposed to have cost 5-1/2 million dollars — easily worth almost P100 million here.</p>								<p>How many friends did Uncle Sam win by his generous display?  Hardly any — for all were her friends to begin with.  But Wanda, a plucky Dutch girl, choked up trying to tell me how much <i>Klim Milk</i> meant to her, plus butter, and cheese.
