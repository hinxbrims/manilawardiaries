Four large cocktails later I just knew I <i>had to</i> eat and dance.  I'm not ashamed to admit that as a rule I don't drink, but this New Year's Day is only my second party in six months and I needed to loosen up.</p>								<p>The midnight noise was banned this year so the night passed quietly in most places.  A Neighborhood Association meeting in Paco was oblivious to the change of year, but there were wild celebrations at a few scattered places downtown.  At 0400, a crowd went to the Remedios Hospital<sup>†</sup> in <a href="../../mapper/malate.html">Malate</a> and sang <i>God Bless America</i> for the American internees.  Severo Tuason attended a private party in San Juan where someone would grab the mike and sing the same after every dance.</p>								<p>After two years here, the Japanese have lost the battle for the hearts of Filipinos.  War news has been one-sided of late — the Axis is on the defensive everywhere.  Filipinos can hardly wait for the Americans to return, and even politicians like Laurel cannot ignore the sentiments of his people.  Big things are expected this year, but not for a while yet — and what price will we pay for our deliverance?</p>								<p class="footnote" style="margin-top: 48px"><sup>† </sup>Formerly the Malate School, converted to a hospital early in the war by the Red Cross.</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
