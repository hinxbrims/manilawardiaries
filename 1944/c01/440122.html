Despite "tremendous losses and setbacks," the enemy is "gradually advancing their bases" and "attacking our lines of sea communications."  But, "woe to the countries that dare come against our Empire, founded upon a peerless national policy and holding a position of invincibility."  Well, the "invincible" seem only capable of retreating</p>								<div class="image right" style="width: 180; margin-top: 15px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 25px">					<img src="wanted.jpg" border="0" width="180" height="134" alt="wanted">					<div class="caption" style="margin-top: 11px">					Desperately seeking workers					</div>				</div>				<p>All over town there are more and more signs asking for laborers, and therein lies a tale.  The Japanese never found it easy to hire laborers.  That's part of the reason why some American POWs are still working.  In the beginning, the Japanese paid poorly and physically abused their laborers.  Naturally, they resigned in droves.  Signs then appeared promising "good treatment," and later, improved wages.  Then the Japanese began to fortify southern provinces against invasion; but if the Filipinos in Luzon were intractable, those in the southern provinces were impossible.  So now the Japanese have to promise a good wage, free transportation, free room and board, a rice ration of 300 grams <i>every day</i>; and even allow good workers to bring their families along!  The many advertisements prove that Filipinos are reluctant to work for the Japanese despite the tough economic times, particularly in Manila where the cost of living is impossibly high.</p>								<p>A Neighborhood Association leader, Raul J. Akot, complained in the Public Pulse yesterday that their ration of camote was one-third dirt, soil and leaves, and another third rotten.  They were forced to buy the camotes to get their ration of rice.  "This is not a fair deal," he rightly says.</p>								<p></p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
