In the last three months, the Japanese may have blocked the latter as no money got through despite repeated cables from the Swiss Consulate here.  Santo Tomas has been buying on credit, but the companies providing it can't wait too long for payment — they'd lose too much in the declining exchange rate and inflation.  Incidentally, the Japanese exchange incoming money at the prewar rate of 2.2-Yen per Peso, but outgoing money is changed at only 1.0-Yen per Peso.</p>								<p>Tribune: "Amnesty Week Proclaimed.  Guerrillas urged to take advantage of proclamation" — before it expires on January 25.  Quite a few have been giving up, but I doubt if they are real guerrillas.</p>								<p>The Minister of Health, Labor and Public Welfare, Emiliano Tria Tirona, "dressed like a common laborer ... to acquire first-hand knowledge on what a poor family is up against in its struggle to meet the rising cost of prime necessities."  He bought some of these necessities, then confronted the market-master and vendors, but all he could do was to ask them to try and sell to the poor at close to the "controlled prices."</p>								<p>Some 200 submitted a complaint to Malacañan that their rice was unfairly confiscated at Tutuban station.
