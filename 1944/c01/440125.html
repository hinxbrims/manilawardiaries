All towns in Iloilo now under control."  Besides the 2,000 mentioned, including officials of the guerilla movement, the mother of Confessor, and the acting Spanish Consul of Iloilo, another 10,000 from Iloilo and 5,000 from Negros are expected to present themselves and take the oath.</p>								<p>Mayor [Guinto] urges guerrillas to give up before amnesty expires" — at midnight.  As to rumored zonings in Manila, he said he's not aware of any plan <i>unless</i> the people don't cooperate.  One town that will be entirely free of guerrillas is Marikina as it's next in line for zonification; 400 have left for Laguna.  Some 300 <i>Ganaps</i> used to roost there, of which 187 were shot dead and all but a very few were forced to "surrender unconditionally."  It seems that three Ganaps are working for the Japanese Military Police.</p>								<p>A friend of mine, Guzman, went to the City Hall this afternoon to get amnestied for the third time.  In other words, the numbers of surrendering guerrillas reported in the papers include the same persons over and over again.</p>								<p>Circulating around town is a five-page typewritten résumé of a recent Laurel-Buencamino talk.  Laurel complained that he had to deal with five <i>governments</i>: The Japanese Army, the Navy, the Embassy (Murata), the guerrillas, and his own government.  Buencamino complained about the difficulties of getting rice in, including graft by the Japanese in all the departments of Naric and the provinces.</p>								<p></p>								<p></p>								<p></p>								<blockquote></blockquote>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
