				<p class="first">Coming home this afternoon, I had forgotten all about the Japanese looking for forced labor at <a href="../../mapper/sanmig.html">Arlegui</a>.  I caught up with Pete Siy and we turned into Aviles together, pumping each other for news.  It was too late to turn by the time I noticed a Spaniard on a bike ahead showing his pass to six or seven Japanese soldiers.  I stopped and showed my pass, opening the little black bag I usually carry.  In it were two loaves of rice bread and three-dozen coconut macaroon cookies, but the Japanese nearest me was only interested in my bike — it was obvious by the way he held it.  My heart sank.  <em>My bike!  After all this time</em>.</p>
				
				<p class="dialogB">"Anong trabajo?" asked one.  [What's your work?]  I pretended to be dumb.  He repeated the question several times to no avail.  Finally I decided to take command.</p>
				
				<p class="dialogA">"Me," I said, thumping my chest vigorously, "live Manga Avenue.  Same street Military Police, Commander Ito — Military Police.  Same street."</p>
				
				<p class="dialogB">"Don't spik Engrish," he answered stiffly.</p>
				
				<p>The fellow in charge pointed a finger at me and said something sharply in Japanese, but somehow, he didn't impress me.</p>
				
				<p class="dialogA">"Captain Ito, Military Police.  Me, Manga Avenue!  Sergeant Kunishi...you know Sergeant Kunishi?"</p>
				
				<p class="dialogB">"No spik Engrish."  So I shrugged and tried to look even dumber.  A pause followed.</p>
				
				<p class="dialogB">Suddenly, looking inspired, the first one asked: "You spik Spanish?"</p>
				
				<p class="dialogA">"NO!"  I blurted out in a flash of inspiration, looking even dumber.</p>
				
				<p class="dialogB">After a few words between themselves, one turned to me and said: "Aw ... go-go-go-go."  So I did ... very much relieved.</p>
				
				<p>Pete also got by with a pass from the Embassy people sharing his house.  Catching up to me he said: "<i>They would have taken you for forced labor but the officer said: 'Aw, let him go — we can't understand him anyway.'</i>"</p>
				
				<p>"<em>It's a good thing I don't speak Spanish</em>," I grinned, and he burst out laughing.</p>
				
				<p class="center">...ooOoo...</p>
