In view thereof, the Committee enjoins your cooperation and requests that you vacate said premises not later than December 5, 1944.  Very respectfully signed, Jose Figueras, Central Housing Committee, <i>Deputy Military Governor</i>.</blockquote>								<p>That's all.  Just GET OUT!  The big question is whether the Military Police is in cahoots with the Embassy or not.  I'm going to visit the Altwegg-Graemiger-Bessmer house, thence to Campos and our two Manga Avenue leaders, Lombek and Alberto.  I expect we'll all eventually go and talk to the Military Police at the end of the block.</p>								<p>1600: There's a big thick plot in the air and it stinks.  I've been able to sniff out the cast of characters in the play.  Characters one and two are Bernard and Okazaki, the last one a fat, rotund and amiable Japanese Embassy official.  Characters three and four are Figueras and an innocent and much taken-in member of the Military Police â€” interpreter Takashima.</p>								<p>Okazaki and the Embassy helped the Bernards to retain their house after the Military Police "took" it.  It so happens that the Bernards and Okazaki get together quite often, and once, Figueras and Takashima joined them for a game of mahjong.  Enter the bombing of Manila and the flight of Japanese officials to safer areas and it comes down to 'Oky' saying that he needs to get another house in Manga Avenue for the Embassy.  Swell idea, another says, but none are available, no?  Then the sweet, purring voice of treachery starts: <i>But why not?  There's the Brimo house, isn't there?  After all, they are only three in that big house</i>.  And if the interpreter had any pangs about the promised protection, it was easily soothed: "<i>Only THREE</i>," you see.  So Figueras is "in" and Oky gets to work, handing Ma the paper today.  And that's the end of ACT I of this drama I'm calling "Our House."</p>								<p>While I was talking to Duran, Campos and the young Alberto, who should barge in but Mattman, who lives with the Bernards.  Gus Mattman used to be a responsible Swiss but he has slid down the ways a bit.  Nobody trusts him anymore because of his friendship with the Bernards.  And what is Mattman's response when he is filled in with the details?  "<i>Oh, we knew that three or four weeks ago....  After all, you are only three in that house</i>"!  Everybody else takes our side, you see, but not Gus.  There's one big reason why they should take our side of course.  As Duran once explained, "<i>You today, the rest of us tomorrow</i>."</p>								<p>So Mattman came to invite Duran to the Bernards for a game of poker.  Takashima should be there and Duran will ask him over to his house for a drink tomorrow, as they seem to "<i>get along</i>" with each other.  Then we'll take him to our house and show him all the furniture we are holding for the other families.  If we can get him to take us to see Military Police Chief Ito, then we have a chance.  So tonight ACT II unfolds and soon after, ACT III and IV with Okazaki and Ito, and maybe Figueras.  What will I say?  Only God knows.</p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
