Freddie Kaufmann sidled up to me in church then whispered all too loudly: "<i>Have you seen the papers?  The Americans have landed in Mindoro</i>."  A few people turned around, electrified by his words.  The fellow in the pew in front dropped his paper on the floor, and we read the headline: "25 American Vessels Sunk or Damaged off Mindoro."  A man at the end of the pew kept craning his neck as he fingered his rosary, trying to figure out what it meant.</p>								<p>After Mass the newspaper boy sold out quick.  No one appeared excited — the people have had a few years of practice at hiding their feelings.  The tension was there though, and spread to the soldiers buying Japanese papers from another boy.</p>								<p>"<i>Mindoro!</i>" said a friend expansively.  "<i>Now we know we're next — there's nothing but us next door</i>."</p>								<p>"<em>Keep your shirt on</em>," I answered, telling him we would have to wait some 30 to 45 days — and I knew I was being optimistic.</p>								<p>He just smiled and said: "<i>OK, make it 90 days.  But we're next!</i>"  I didn't take that away from him.</p>								<p>The Tribune said that the landing took place on December 15 — 48 hours ago!  It went to town claiming a number of ships sunk between December 13 and 15, but no one here cared — the papers have cried "wolf" too many times.</p>								<div class="image left" style="width: 270; margin-top: 15px; margin-left: 22px; margin-right: 12px">					<img src="441217_downed.png" border="0" width="270" height="290" alt="Downed Aircraft">					<div class="caption" style="margin-top: 15px">					Downed Aircraft					</div>				</div>								<p>"U.S. Raiders Exact Toll on Civilians" — the article only proves it was due to antiaircraft.  A picture shows the plane downed at 0310 the other morning; it fell in the southern part of the Northern Cemetery.  The fin looks like an F6F's with a painted white roundel and maybe a "6" inside it.  Manilans are skeptical.</p>								<p>"Fighting rages in Ormoc area" is a small article on the lower part of page 1.  That's where Leyte is now in the news — almost forgotten.<br><br></p>				<p style="text-align: right" class="inLink"><br><a href="441217b.html"> continues...</a></p>				<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
