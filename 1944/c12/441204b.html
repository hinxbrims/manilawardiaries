She is confined to bed even now</em>."</p>								<p>"<i>She wouldn't ... in the beginning ... even let me in</i>," he complained.</p>								<p>"<em>The orders of the Kempeitai are to send all Japanese looking for houses to them as Manga Avenue is a Military Police Zone</em>," I said.</p>								<p>"<i>Yes but...</i>" began Okazaki, but I pressed on.</p>								<p>"<em>My mother suffers from high blood pressure.  I apologize for her condition</em>."  He waved it aside, biting his lips.  I continued: "<em>The military police had not said a word to me or anyone else on the matter.  Our relations have been...</em>"</p>								<p>Okazaki banged a piece of paper on his desk, saying, "<i>What can I do?  I am in a difficult position.  I don't like it.  I was told to get the houses.  What can I do?</i>"  He turned and began a three-minute conversation with another Japanese across the room, obviously complaining about the stubborn guy in front of him who wanted to argue about a Kempeitai guarantee.  Then he was silent for a moment.  I waited ... it was obvious he was licked in this round ... why push my luck?</p>								<p>He finally turned: "<i>I tell you what ... you go and tell Captain Ito to get in touch with the Embassy</i>."  My instructions were the opposite â€” to get Oky to negotiate with the Kempeitai, but this would do too.  Ito could stall for time, and time was important.  I kept quiet; he was obviously uncomfortable.  "<i>Yes, you go and see Captain Ito</i>," he said and stood up.</p>								<p>"<em>Thank you</em>," I said, pumping his hand to his discomfiture.  "<em>I appreciate your kindness ... thanks very much again</em>."  And so saying, I quickly turned and left.</p>								<p>The rest of the day was not uneventful for Manga Avenue.  Julio Kaufmann was robbed of his bicycle, a bayong of vegetables and cash at the top of Santa Mesa Bridge.  As one robber left with the loot, the other walked him down the bridge and through a crowd, arm in arm like the best of pals while poking a pistol into his ribs.  The robber told him to stay home if he valued the lives of his family, and that they'd pay him a visit there later that afternoon!</p>				<p>An hour later, a Japanese-driven car hit young Conchita Gonzalez as she cycled home.  The driver castigated her for being "careless" then drove her home.  Later, Drs. Ayesa and Alberto Jr. patched her up; one of her ears required seven stitches.</p>				<p>Takashima came at dusk, arriving in the midst of a melee of people discussing the threat to Julio and today's unfortunate events.  Julio's brother and his son were taken in a recent zonification of Santol, so he appealed to Takashima for help.  I could see Takashima was getting dizzy so we agreed to talk tomorrow.</p>				<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
