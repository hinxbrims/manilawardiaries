A big transport and three smaller troop transports were sunk, while the remaining two ships, a medium transport and an escort destroyer, were left ablaze.  MacArthur estimated that a total of 26,000 Japanese troops have perished trying to get into Leyte.</p>								<p>A four-alarm fire just after 1900 gave us all quite a thrill.  "<i>Don't worry</i>," I said too quickly during supper, "<i>it's just the fire engine here</i>."  Five minutes later, Ma called me to the rear to have a look.  The Santa Mesa Cine, an ancient wooden landmark adjacent to Figueras' house on <a href="../../_maps/mangaave.html">Buenos Aires</a> bordering Santa Mesa Avenue, was on fire.  And what a fire it was!  All Santa Mesa and Manga Avenue turned out to watch it blaze.  The Japanese have been stocking it with supplies ever since they occupied it a month ago.</p>								<p>Fire engines arrived as battalions of troops ran with buckets or long wooden poles.  High-ranking Japanese officers stormed down toward the fire in long determined strides, looking angry and no doubt thinking sabotage.  And all around people gathered to watch the conflagration.  As I dashed towards Santa Mesa Extension for a better view, a friend caught up with me.  "<i>Too bad the wind is going that-a-way.  It would surely get Figueras' house if it was the opposite direction</i>," he said panting.  What poetic justice that would be for the man who has given the Japanese house after house to occupy, and given ours away twice!</p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
