FATHER THEO BUTTENBRUCH!  December 16, 1944, along with approximately 300 others â€” all executed by the sword.  All went quietly and bravely, including 17 or so Ateneo boys.  With Father Theo to lead them, I imagine they went peacefully and gallantly.</p>								<p>Biking down Arlegui, a friendly yell of "<i>Henry, turn back!</i>" sent me skidding to a stop.  "<i>The Japs are [ahead] at Quezon Boulevard picking up men for forced labor</i>."  We biked around them using another route.</p>								<p>At the Escolta the air raid siren went on at <b>1030</b> and people started dashing for cover.  I went into the street and finally saw a few P-38s after missing three formations of B-24s probably returning from a raid.  The P-38s didn't follow them but headed for Marikina, where they dove to strafe targets.  Not used to the lack of antiaircraft fire, they weren't as casual as the Navy pilots.  Many were impressed by the B-24s: "<i>All white and silvery ... and MASSIVE</i>," said one.  Some thought they were B-29s.  A rice vendor on the sidewalk chipped in: "<i>Beautiful planes.  If there's a raid here tomorrow, that means another landing</i>," he said, rolling his eyes eloquently.</p>								<p>Japanese troops continued on their northward trek.  All day long, caravans of Japanese horses returned to Manila with empty carts to load up and head back north by nightfall.  I pity the people in their path.  I've already heard that Marikina had been cleaned out of chickens and pigs.</p>				<p>A definite but unconfirmed report says American POWs from the ships arrived here but left for the north.  That means another trek and more suffering.</p>				<p>Tonight, a B-24 dropped a solitary bomb on Nichols and headed north.  It returned four times at twenty-minute intervals, and was finally found by the searchlights.  A few antiaircraft shots were fired at it ineffectively. </p>				<p>LEYTE: The northern and southern American forces have met and are mopping up.</p>								<p style="text-align: right" class="inLink"><br><a href="441223b.html"> continues...</a></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
