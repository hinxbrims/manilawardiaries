"Nippon Land Forces Capture Two Enemy Airbases at Burauen" (December 6); "12 Warships, Transports Blasted"; "Enemy forces, about one division strong, launched landing operations in the vicinity of Albuera" (just south of Ormoc near <a href="../../_maps/leyte.html">Ipil</a>, December 7).</p>				<div class="image center" style="width: 476; margin-top: -1px; margin-left: 24px; margin-right: 6px">					<img src="leyte_mts.jpg" border="0" width="476" height="300" alt="leyte terrain">					<div class="caption" style="margin-top: 5px">					Attrition in Rugged Leyte					</div>				</div>								<p>Daihon-ei is contradictory: "U.S. Attempt to make New Landings Foiled" — American ships were attacked and later seen fleeing through the Surigao Strait.  "At present, the Japanese Air Force is mopping up a LANDED enemy detachment."  And if that isn't clear enough: "Heavy Fighting Rages at Albuera."</p>								<p>Editorial: "Sweeping out the Invaders": Yamashita said, "I will crush the enemy," who he called the "second Magellan" of Leyte.  Koiso said Japanese forces would "drive out the enemy from the Island to the sea."</p>								<p>George phoned before noon.  He didn't even have to speak; I could hear his Dad yelling, "<i>Get that stupid radio out of the house — NOW!</i>"  I arrived in seven minutes and shortly after was on the other side of a deserted Santa Mesa Avenue with the radio securely strapped on its accustomed rack.  The next step required a 150-meter uphill walk with the bike over the exposed Santa Mesa water pipeline to the corner of <a href="../../_maps/mangaave.html">Manga Avenue</a>, in full view of the Japanese sentry seated on my right across the street.  Holding the bicycle on my left, the first 75 meters went without incident.  Suddenly, a loud imperial whistle made me jump out of my skin.  I didn't stop to see if it was meant for me though there was nobody else around.  I kept walking ... the corner was almost at hand.  The second whistle came too late to prevent me rounding into Manga Avenue.  Less than three minutes later I was home.  This time it took quite a few minutes for me to calm my nerves.</p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
