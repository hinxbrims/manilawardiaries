The Japanese detained all the men but returned most of them in the afternoon.  Three Japanese had been slain the night before — and the Japanese took revenge by killing five Filipinos and burying them where the three victims were found.  Later they <i>zonified</i> the district.  Their soldiers had a field day — consuming 2-1/2 bottles of rum at a friend's place, taking money at another's house, and acting generally rough.  Local women were terror-stricken, but the whole thing ended at 1400.  The boundary of the zonification almost reached Altura, which runs parallel to Manga Avenue at our back.</p>								<p>Our House: Our colossal run of luck continues.  Time grows shorter each day so we feel we can last it out.  We still haven't heard from the Embassy, but our house is technically reserved for them, and this technicality is saving us from, of all people, the Military Police themselves!  They've been pestering the Kaufmanns and Menzis, and have been inquiring about our house to the neighbors, who've been inquiring about it to me.  My answer is always: "<em>The Embassy will take it.  We're waiting notice — with a little luck we may be able to stay downstairs</em>."</p>								<p>Maurice decided to leave his house though he hasn't received a final notice.  He says the Japanese in the neighborhood are getting too troublesome, putting gasoline drums all around his house, encroaching on his garden, entering when he's away and being generally uncouth about it all.  So he's moving in the next two or three days if he can find transportation.</p>								<p>NEWS: Fighting continues in Leyte.  The Americans bypassed Valencia, took its airfield, and were on their way to meet their counterparts in the west.  MacArthur officially put Japanese casualties at 88,000, with 40,200-plus officially buried by the Americans.  It's said that one Tokyo report admitted 160,000 Japanese casualties, but that would be out of character.  According to American figures, the Japanese lost 727 planes in one week — 27 over Mindoro two days ago and 26 more yesterday.</p>								<p>Time was when the Japanese were moving troops and munitions to the south; now they are only heading north.  The feeling is rising that Manila may escape a bloody battle.</p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
