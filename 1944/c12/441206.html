U.S. Losses in Leyte Mounting" — all about the kamikazes disrupting U.S. task forces; the "Kaoru" airborne units destroying Leyte airfields, and Japanese "close-range assault units" piercing U.S. lines.  But the next column says, "American units southwest of Carigara [are] attempting to reach the <a href="../../_maps/leyte.html">Ormoc Highway</a>."</p>								<p>"Foe admits Tokyo area well defended" — quoting an American communiqué to wit: "Several formations of our planes were subjected to strong counterattacks by Japanese fighters."  The Japanese gave citations to Corp. Yoshio Mida who crash-dived into a B-29 over Tokyo on November 24, and the same to Lt. Shinomiya, Sgt. Sawamoto and Corp. Itakagi for crash-diving into B-29s on December 3.  "Shinomiya managed to get back with his plane."  And so did most B-29s, I guess.</p>								<p>Manila was abuzz over a B-24 that came over at <b>2130</b> last night.  Flying low and slow, it had toured the airfields at least twice before a Japanese searchlight found it.  In an instant, more than a dozen beams of light converged on the solitary plane.  The crew took no evasive action because the antiaircraft batteries were unmanned.  So, lit up like a giant glittering diamond, it majestically proceeded on its search pattern, undisturbed by the searchlights following it in entranced silence.  After checking all four-corners of the Nichols-Nielson airfields, it dropped two big bombs and sailed away.  Finally, a pom-pom firing tracers and an antiaircraft unit firing flare-like shells from the Bay bade it farewell.  It was a show Manilans will never forget.</p>								<p>Our House: Another act is on and we're behind the 8-ball.  First, Figueras has taken a strong stand.  Second, it appears that Captain Ito has sold us down the river.  Speaking to Sotelo, Figueras threatened to arrest my dad.  He was in an uproar for our non-appearance at his office when we had been "ordered" to appear.  It was just intimidation because there was no order.  Still, we're playing ball and going to see him tomorrow.</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
