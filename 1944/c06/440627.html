The rocket is more important.</p>								<p>"Germans ready on Eastern Front ... to cope with any emergency....  When the decisive moment comes ... the Germans will gain command of the military situation without losing time."  <em>That sounds about right: An emergency is likely and the Germans do not have control of the military situation.</em></p>								<p>"President defines role of Teachers" — defining is all he can do lately: Constabulary, scientists, youths...  </p>								<p>La Vanguardia: "Dioquino, chief of prisoners" — named interim head of the Bureau of Prisons. Eriberto B. Misa was fired due to the Muntinglupa Prison break abetted by the guerrillas.</p>								<p>About 3,000 American POWs from Mindanao marched through Manila on their way to Bilibid.  Without exaggeration they were the worst looking group of POWs we've seen; many sporting long beards and wearing torn rags.  This is the gang that was sent south long ago to work on the hemp and failed cotton plantations.  They sailed up in the holds of a Japanese transport.  A third-party national passenger reported he couldn't sleep out of worry for the boys.  The verdict was unaimous here — a DAMN SHAME.</p>								<p>At the time they went south in 1942, a Japanese going with them who spoke English well visited a third-party national he had known in Japan to say his goodbyes.  "Where are you going?"  He was asked.  "<i>To Mindanao with the American prisoners ... but I expect to be transferred to Australia later — my English, you know</i>."  Oh yeah?</p>								<p>News: Mount Tapotchau, the highest point in Saipan, taken; Americans have half of Saipan but the Japanese are fighting desperately.  U.S. Task Force raids Guam and Rota.
