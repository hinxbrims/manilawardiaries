The Editorial nonsense of the day tries to pin the blame for the lack of sugar on the Americans.  A hundred-pound sack of sugar is now P1,100!  Still, Laurel wants suggestions.

You can imagine my plight.  They had some cash and a valuable stamp collection.  A friend had advised them to sell everything, but he had no advice on what to do with the money.  I said:</p>								<p class="dialogA">"Buy all the food you need, change to genuine cash, hold your stamps."</p>								<p class="dialogB">"But suppose we have to leave the house?"</p>								<p class="dialogA">"Take the stamps along."</p>				<p class="dialogB">"Suppose we have to leave in a hurry."</p>								<p class="dialogA">"Make any sacrifice, but take the stamps."</p>								<p class="dialogB">"Suppose we are robbed?"</p>								<p class="dialogA">"Cheer up, you might have been killed," I said before kicking myself.</p>								<p class="dialogB">"Should we buy some shares?"</p>								<p class="dialogA">"If you can get good ones; I can't find any."</p>								<p class="dialogB">"Who can appraise the value of these stamps?"</p>								<p class="dialogA">"Nobody — correctly.  He'd have to be clairvoyant.  Values change from day to day, if Germany fell shortly, their value could increase even more."</p>								<p>The family had already sold two pianos for P28,000, and I knew the cash had already lost some value.  I took a deep breath.</p>								<p class="dialogA">"Inflation is a trying time.  Not only money but HEALTH is involved.  Worrying will get you nowhere....  My advice: Keep genuine currency, keep well supplied, and hang on to your assets as long as you can."</p>								<p>After 45 minutes I was exhausted and glad I had to leave to catch a ride home in Schaer's truck.</p>									</td>			</tr>		</table>	</div>	<div class="footer2">		<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="710" align="left">			<tr align="center">				<td align="center" valign="top" width="55">					&nbsp;				</td>				<td align="center" valign="top" width="200">					&nbsp;				</td>				<td align="center" valign="top" width="246">				<br><span class="inLink"><a href="#p1">- Top -</a></span>				</td>								<td align="center" valign="top" width="209">					&nbsp;				</td>			</tr>		</table>	</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->        <a name="p3"></a>	<div class="header2">		&nbsp;	</div>	<div class="main2">		<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="710" align="center">			<tr align="center">				<td align="center" valign="top" width="55">					&nbsp;				</td>				<td align="left" valign="top" width="655">				<div class="inLink">| <a href="#p1">Pg.1 Marianas</a>| <a href="#p2">Pg.2 Advice</a> | &#9733; |				</div>				<span class="date">June 15, 1944</span>				<p class="first">What a mess!  Anselmo Trinidad told me today, "I'm trying to buy all the food I can...."  I asked, "But how are the poor going to live?"  My mind is preoccupied with this problem.  Aurelio Montinola, who was playing golf with Laurel when he was shot, told me a month ago: "I told Laurel ... take care of the poor no matter what it costs..." and I agreed it had to be done.</p>								<p>The crying need of the hour is leadership — just what is lacking.  Platitudes and paternal benevolence is all Laurel can exude.  Leadership can be shown in hundreds of ways — one is getting money for the poor via the government and via the rich.  Ah, the rich — what a talking-to they need!  But where is the leadership to point the way?  Has Laurel asked for — no, demanded — food?  Why is the Philippine government skimping over money when the Japanese are gushing it out and undermining the currency anyway?  How can government employees or the Constabulary be expected to remain loyal and straight when they cannot live on their salaries alone?</p>				<p class="center">. . . .</p>								<p>A friend of mine saw Manuel Roxas today.  Roxas looked up grimly and said, "<i>Sorry, I'm not in the mood to talk today.  Come tomorrow</i>." </p>				<p>La Vanguardia: "Laurel to assume direct supervision of Manila....  No changes expected."</p>				<p>One more item from the Tribune: "Group of third party aliens now in Manila."  They are on their way "elsewhere" having been brought from the southern parts of the country.  "The matter was made public to prevent any groundless rumors suggesting that the visitors are prisoners of war or internees."  The denial is because they ARE being treated that way to prevent them from talking about the situation in the south.</p>				<p class="center">...ooOoo...</p>			</tr>		</table>	</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer2">		<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="710" align="left">			<tr align="center">				<td align="center" valign="top" width="55">					&nbsp;				</td>				<td align="center" valign="top" width="200">					&nbsp;				</td>				<td align="center" valign="top" width="246">				<br><span class="inLink"><a href="#p1">- Top -</a></span>				</td>								<td align="center" valign="top" width="209">					&nbsp;				</td>			</tr>		</table>	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
