The Japanese are strong in China and still holding in Burma; the Germans look very weak in Russia but the stalemate continues — the Allies are paying a stiff price in equipment for small gains.  The long-promised annihilation of the Luftwaffe is only half realized.  For all the sixty carriers the Americans boast of in the South Pacific, the Japanese have learned not to expose their ships and planes under such grossly uneven odds as at Truk and Palau.  Meanwhile, time marches on for those in occupied territories.</p>								<p>In the island of Panay, for example, the Japanese are landing 25,000 troops in yet another punitive expedition.  They are well aware that U.S. submarines have landed much equipment (guerilla scale) in Panay, Negros and similar places, and the time has come to clean house.  A terrible calamity will befall the people there, particularly the innocent.  The Japanese, with strict orders to wipe out guerilla and unruly elements, will not dilly-dally with the technicalities of right and wrong in each individual case.</p>								<p>I can't but conclude that the Anglo-American efforts are well below their full capabilities; but before I cast any more aspersions, I'll wait out June and July ... for BIG THINGS.  Meanwhile, may God help those peoples oppressed, hungering and defiled, wherever they may be, including the German people.  Oh but what a world of good a single bullet with Hitler's name on it could do!</p>								<p>Tribune: "Japs inflict 1,000 casualties on foe in Biak Island....  Enemy landing force being squeezed along narrow beachhead" — all unofficial from a "South Pacific base."</p>								<p>La Vanguardia: "Two-month resistance has telling effect on Imphal defenders ... extreme shortages of foodstuffs, ammunition and supplies."  But the Japanese have plenty, eh?  Enough apparently to repulse an "enemy counterattack in Kohima."</p>								<p></p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
