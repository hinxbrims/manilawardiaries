"The American Fleet is ready and anxious to accept battle."  Many Filipinos went to church to light candles and pray for victory.  Others had other ideas.  A big fire started in the Port Area.  By 0900 the smoke looked like rain clouds.</p>								<p>In the evening the local radio announced a partial blackout.  A Tagalog announcer managed to say it was because Manila was "<i>now under range of American planes.</i>"  At 1700 today all the Japanese ships in Manila Bay scooted away.  By nightfall not a ship was to be seen!  Earlier this week, an aircraft carrier and a couple of cruisers left Manila Bay.</p>								<p>At 2200, Maurice and I were walking back from a game of Bridge at the Sotelo's.  Crossing Santa Mesa we heard an order in Tagalog that didn't appear to be addressed to us.  We kept walking.  We heard another call.  Maurice said it was probably meant for the house with a light showing.  On the third call Maurice stopped, turned around and put his hands up.  From the dark appeared five men fanning out, the leader's pistol pointing right at Maurice.  We were searched.  "<i>Why didn't you put your hands up?  I almost fired</i>," said the leader, his voice betraying intense emotion.  I said, "<em>Why didn't you say so in English?</em>"  They were relieved we were unarmed and escorted us part of the way home.  Explaining last night's incident to Penny, he warned me: "<em>The Constabulary can fire and no longer be questioned for it</em>."  A few said we were nuts to go out during the blackout.  We think so too.</p>								<p>I passed by the Escolta at noon today just after a shooting incident at the Samanillo Building.  A few days ago I missed the shooting and killing of Dr. Jose Villacorta at his laboratory on Rizal Avenue by sixty seconds.  A bystander told me it was the work of the "Texas Gang."</p>								<p>Provincial Notes: In Pampanga, friction between the people and the Constabulary is at boiling point.  A barrio gang ambushed and killed six PC.  The PC raided a village in retaliation, killing fourteen.  The Mayor of Looban and my informant left for Manila as the PC were about to start another raid.  They told Laurel to call off the "high-handed, bossy" PC; if this continued, they warned, rice planting would be 50% down.</p>								<p>Tribune: "22 enemy warships sunk and damaged off Marianas ... 300 planes shot down."  The statement that caused a furor here: "On our side there were considerable losses of ships and planes."</p>								<p>Other News: The Americans have taken the remaining two airfields on Biak.</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
