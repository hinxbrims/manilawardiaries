A Japanese air unit heavily damaged one of the vessels" off Saipan.  All their planes returned safely, of course.  About 170 U.S. planes raided Guam (the radio said 100) and 16 were downed.  The Japanese suffered "no damage."</p>								<p>The Editorial moans about the recent killings, but "what makes matters even worse is the ugly invention of the most incredible lies woven by the filthy imagination around the murders."</p>								<p>La Vanguardia: Laurel nominates leaders for Nadisco.  L.R. Aguinaldo will lead it — he'll now play stooge and be as helpless as his predecessors.</p>								<p>Two days ago a friend went to cash a P1,000 check at the Yokohama Specie Bank.  Apologizing for running out of money, the bank asked him to return tomorrow.  He did and got his money — in 50-cent pieces!  Other banks are limiting withdrawals to P1,000 or also running out of cash.  Rumors and stories like this keep people from entrusting their cash to the banks, hence the continuing shortage.  Furthermore, people fear an invasion could close the banks, preventing them from spending their cash before it becomes worthless.  The shortage is such that the Japanese and some firms have had to suspend payments.  The Japanese flew some money in from Japan today — including P1,000 bills.</p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
