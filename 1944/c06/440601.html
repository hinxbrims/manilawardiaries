Just Daihon-ei trying to sensationalize American casualties.  As for Burma, "Enemy operations in Kohima halted."</p>								<p>"Over one million families in Neighborhood Association" — and hardly any will get their rations.</p>								<p>It's said that rice rations to Jews, Chinese and Bombays will cease effective immediately.  "<i>Well I guess we Spaniards are next</i>," said one, "<i>we're strangers here</i>".</p>								<p>"<i>Well then</i>," laughed a prominent Filipino, "<i>we too will have to go without rice — we're strangers here too</i>".</p>								<p>The Astoria was searched again.  If Schaer had bribed the first inspectors, he would've had to do it again for the following bunch or two.  Anyway, the Astoria hasn't served rice for well over two months.</p>								<p>I checked the Quiapo Market to see what was available.  Stalls were jam-packed with vegetables, dried fish, meat and fruit, plus plenty of prewar canned goods: pickles, jams, soup and just about everything.  The problem is, of course, the price.  Vendors won't even shave a few centavos off.  The same applies to medicines.  You won't find them in the drug stores but they are sold openly in the black market.</p>								<p>Consider the case of one P., a decent fellow who speculates on medicines.  Without a job, the only way he can keep his family fed is by <i>preserving</i> his money's worth.  He chose medicines.  He bought 20 ampoules of Calcium for P400 that are now worth P2,000.  "<i>Can I say I've made money?  No, I've arrested its depreciation — that's all.  I'm not speculating in medicines because in my case they're necessary</i>."  Others are using the same justification, but to clean up.</p>								<p>Today, a Chinese speculator at the Astoria boasted of his great buy: Prontolin.  Is there a big demand for it?  Probably not, but he says it'll keep its value "<i>because the Chinese have cornered the market</i>"!</p>								<p>NEWS: The Americans are within sight of Rome.  The Japanese might take the Wuhan railroad and split Chungking north and south forces.  The Chinese admit the situation is "very grave."</p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
