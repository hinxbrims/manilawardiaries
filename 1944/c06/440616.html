I found out at 0800 and met only one person who didn't know.  Everywhere I went it was, "Hey!  Henry!  Come here a moment..." and the smirk on their faces showed they <i>knew</i>.  "Later," I'd reply, deciding to be discreet — no sense getting tabbed now.</p>								<p>Daihon-ei: "143 U.S. planes downed in China; 88 vessels sunk."  It's propaganda by headline: For a start it's for 12-days — "From June 1 to June 12."  Of 21 planes shot down, 5 were "probables."  Of the rest, 54 were "set ablaze" and 68 were "damaged."  Total 143.  "Ships loaded with troops and war materials sunk <i>or damaged</i> — 88."  (See?  It's done with smoke and mirrors.)  Japanese losses: "8 planes."</p>								<p>The Germans are at it too: Today's <i>German Hour</i> from Tokyo speaks of Allied casualties in France for the first ten days as 200,000: Killed in action, 30,000; wounded in action, 100,000 to 120,000; captured, 5,000; and drowned, 50,000.  The first week it was 85,000; three days later it's 200,000.  Nuts!  The Germans frequently mention that they have to save Allied crews bailing out over France from lynching by French mobs.  Enough said.</p>								<p>Commentator says that as a result of the "devastating loss exacted from the U.S. Air Force in China ... the two-year old plan of the enemy to raid the Japanese mainland would be impossible to realize, <i>not in any near future</i>."  By the time the article hit the streets, the Japanese in Kyushu were battling flames from a raid two hours earlier.</p>								<p>Rumors:</p>								<blockquote>				The Japanese are thinking of re-concentrating the USAFFE because many of them appear to be slipping out of Manila and are up to something.  <em>The rumor itself is forcing some of them to do just that</em>.<br><br>								An American General arrived in the Visayas and found things surprisingly in order.  He's the big shot there.<br><br>								General Lim is a cancer patient at the PGH.  Some were skeptical of why he was there.				</blockquote>				<p>La Vanguardia: "Kyushu bombing fails" — of 20 B-29s and B-24s, "some were immediately shot down and the rest repelled."  Damage was "insignificant."</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
