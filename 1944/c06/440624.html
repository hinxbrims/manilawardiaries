In place of Horai rice, we have a new super-seedling named after Manuel Roxas, to the great man's embarrassment.

More stuff is being unloaded than shipped out, including old anti-aircraft guns.  Ten big piles of cases — probably shells — have been unloaded.  A raid on the Bay and Port Area would reap rich rewards.</p>								<p>When Father Theo was in Fort Santiago, he shared a cell with a 19-year-old youth who had no idea why he had been detained and kept there for 45 days.
