A part of the enemy force that parachuted into Northern Burma has already been annihilated."</p>								<p>"Japs Storm U.S. Position" in Bougainville "stronghold partly taken" — but we have "semi-permanent" positions: six lines of barb wire, tanks, heavy artillery and support from naval guns.</p>								<p>FDR's speech on San Francisco Radio sounded like a diversion, and Churchill's speech lacked the usual fire and rhetoric.  Without propaganda to counter the recent war news, Manila is feeling blue again.  We're impatient: time marches on — and while the Allies are talking, the Axis are acting.  Meanwhile, the outlook here is going from bad to worse.  If the war is going to last another year, we can only hope we'll still be around then.</p>								<p>La Vanguardia: "Enemy fortifications are well defended."  Sounds like the end of Japanese efforts in Bougainville.</p>								<p>Biking to the U.P., Dr. Ayesa's path was blocked by 300 American prisoners marching to work at the docks.  He got off his bike to wait, and naturally, scrutinized the faces for anyone he knew.  The last Japanese guard thought he overdid it, and ordered the doctor to follow the line!  After waiting two hours in the piers, he waited three more hours at the Far Eastern University before the questioning began.</p>								<p class="dialogA">"You," pointing the finger, "why you make signs at American?"</p>								<p class="dialogB">"But I didn't!

"I see!  Very good!  Japanese - Filipinos very good friends, eh?"</p>								<p class="dialogB">"Sure ... sure," replied the relieved doctor.</p>								<p class="dialogA"></p>								<p class="dialogA"></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
