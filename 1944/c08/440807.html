Some say the currency exchange is 15:1.  Local radio hasn't said a word on the European war for 48 hours, only something about a U.S. Task Force raid in the Bonins.</p>								<p>A lot of shots were heard around our district last night.  At first I thought it was a car backfiring, but the noise lasted off-and-on for hours.  This morning the Constabulary was searching both sides of the Santa Mesa Bridge.</p>								<p>More people are standing up to the Japanese about their houses, but only some are getting away with it.  A family that stood up to a recalcitrant officer in an off mood were lined up and subjected to an orgy of slaps...and they had to leave much behind.</p>								<p>The Elizaldes were given 22 hours to vacate their house.  That was enough time to send SOS calls to their neighbors and friends: Come and get anything you can, quick!  When the Japanese arrived, they found the house completely empty.  Score a win for the Elizaldes.</p>								<p>Beware these days if a lot of men come and insist on searching your house in the name of the Military Police.  One fellow unlocked his gates and was robbed of cash, jewelry and food.  On the other hand, another fellow thought the shabbily-uniformed Military Police outside were fakes, and so threw some flowers at them ... still in their pots.  He's still feeling the pain of the repercussions.</p>								<p>There's no camote in the markets today; a native egg now sells for P3.50, bananas are up to P1.50, while vegetables are hard to find.  The ships in the Bay are taking it all.</p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
