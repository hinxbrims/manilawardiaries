The problem is how to admit a retreat from the Imphal range and the loss of Myitkyina.  I imagine it's done this way:</p>								<blockquote><em>OK, show me the map ... here!  What?  It doesn't matter, anywhere will do.  Right, let's put it this way</em>: "In the area of northern Burma, Japanese forces gradually withdrawing from the Hukawng sector have gained" (<em>clever, eh?</em>) "control of a Key Line and also the northern side of the Burma railway line west of Mogaung."  <em>If anyone can figure that out, I'll eat my hat.  Leave it there.  Don't argue, damn it.  Now add this because sooner or later we'll have to admit it</em>: "They" — <em>that's we</em> — "are now facing numerically superior enemy troops."</blockquote>				<blockquote><em>Now, about Myitkyina, just say that we, after staging the usual counter-attacks — successfully of course — against numerically superior enemy troops</em>, "withdrew to a key point in the rear during the nights of August 2 and 3, after breaking through" (<em>we'll have to admit it; they know we were encircled</em>) "the enemy's encircling line."  <em>See?  That was easy.  Print it.  Great job.  Now about that aircraft tally</em>....</blockquote>								<p>"1,030 planes downed during July" — more than half in China.  Of the total, 694 are "heavily damaged" and 17 are "probables."  Japanese losses: 34 "dived on objectives" or "failed to return," and 105 were lost on the ground.  Total 139 — <em>read 'em and weep</em>.</p>								<p>"Loss of four B-29s over Palembang [Sumatra], Kyushu [Japan] admitted....  Raid on Japan complete failure."  We get almost a full column telling us that the damage "was so negligible that it is <i>not worth mentioning</i>."</p>								<p></p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
