The committee on evacuation washed its hands with a short, speedy report: <i>unfeasible, impractical and practically impossible</i>.  Murata apparently agrees.</p>								<p>Laurel told the Zobels he couldn't help them regarding their houses in the Boulevard.  He agreed that going to Calatagan, Batangas, was a good idea, and even wished he could go too (it's his home province).  Just before parting, Laurel said, "By the way, here's a piece of news for you: Saipan has fallen."  It was taken to mean the Philippines comes next, so you'd better hurry.</p>								<p>As for Aquino, at a recent dinner one of the ladies taunted him with: "<em>Say, Benigno, they say the Americans will be here soon and cut your neck off</em>."</p>								<p class="dialogB">Aquino looked shocked and very hurt.  "No they won't," he said in his best-injured tone.</p>								<p class="dialogA">"Oh yes they will," cooed the lady.</p>								<p class="dialogB">"Why should they?" he demanded, putting up a stiff front.  "I only did my duty towards my people.  The Americans ran away and left.  I had to do what I could to save my countrymen."</p>								<p class="center">. . . .</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">			<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="710" align="left">			<tr align="center">				<td align="center" valign="top" width="55">					&nbsp;				</td>				<td align="center" valign="top" width="200">					&nbsp;				</td>				<td align="center" valign="top" width="246">				<br><span class="inLink"><a href="#p1">- Top -</a></span>				</td>								<td align="center" valign="top" width="209">					&nbsp;				</td>			</tr>		</table>	</div>	<!-- ***************** PAGE 2 ***************** --><a name="p2"></a>	<div class="header2">		&nbsp;	</div>	<div class="main2">		<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="710" align="center">			<tr align="center">				<td align="center" valign="top" width="55">					&nbsp;				</td>				<td align="left" valign="top" width="655">			<div class="inLink">| <a href="#p1">Laurel & Aquino</a>| Pg.2 |</div>			<span class="date r">Rice & Houses</span>			<span class="date">August 3, 1944</span>																<p>An "understanding" has restored peace and order in the rice provinces.  On the basis that the next crop would be too late for the Japanese, and the early harvest could be salvaged for the people, the guerilla chiefs, the Constabulary and the Biba got together and cut a deal.  Biba agents will do the buying and distributing on a quota basis so the people and the guerrillas will get their share of rice.  In return, the Constabulary will keep order in the towns, while the guerrillas will do so in the remote regions.  It's a fact — the three entities got together and celebrated their union over a game of poker!  In return for selling some of their rice to Biba at fixed prices, the hacenderos are free to sell the remainder on the black market.  The Japanese agents will pay stiff prices for the small supply left over.  (The rice in the provinces allocated to the Japanese is insufficient for their needs.)</p>								<p>Incidentally, it was Japanese buying, not the rains, that sent the camote price soaring.  Spurred by necessity, the output of camote had increased significantly, but the Japanese took that too.  All those ships in our Bay need provisioning, you see, sometimes for a round trip if they are sailing to ports where food is unavailable.  So Japanese trucks are speeding tons of fruits and vegetables to the port every day.  It's an axiom that the Japanese get the best of everything.  In the case of camotes, tons were shipped out of the Philippines from the Lingayen Gulf.</p>								<p>Anyway, there could be hope for the hungry.  The new harvest begins on October 15, and the price of rice (now P1,200 a sack) could go down — barring invasion, of course.  The town is also over the hump of the evacuation panic.  People are now hoping for a quick end to the European war; crazy rumors to that effect are making the rounds.</p>								<p>Laurel had to bow to the Japanese demand that the entire seashore of Manila be evacuated to a depth of 1/2 mile.  This is sure to jam Manila in the remaining houses; and yet, the big shots of the Japanese Army and Military Police are still trying to get the best houses in the safe districts for themselves.  Only they're meeting up with mighty angry people.  Campos-Rueda told them:</p>				<blockquote>This is the house I have lived in for many, many years.  I expect to die here.  I am an old man and I need it....  I need the comforts of a house like this and the safety of a neighborhood like this.  You army men are used to making sacrifices and facing bombs — it is your duty.  How can you drive us from here?  Where shall we go?  You cannot do such a thing.  We intend to stay to the very bitter end.</blockquote>								<p>The Japanese are thinking it over.  I'm worried that we're next.</p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer2">		<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="710" align="left">			<tr align="center">				<td align="center" valign="top" width="55">					&nbsp;				</td>				<td align="center" valign="top" width="200">					&nbsp;				</td>				<td align="center" valign="top" width="246">				<br><span class="inLink"><a href="#p1">- Top -</a></span>				</td>								<td align="center" valign="top" width="209">					&nbsp;				</td>			</tr>		</table>	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
