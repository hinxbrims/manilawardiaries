Even girls of 12 years and under get full wages and 600 grams of rice for working in the airfields and construction sites.  The rice, cooked as lugao, feeds a family of five, with the barest bit of vegetable or camote added for taste or variety.  Even among the better off, there are few people who haven't lost weight.  Most of them could afford the loss; the poor had no surplus weight but were at least healthy before the war because food and medicines were cheap.
