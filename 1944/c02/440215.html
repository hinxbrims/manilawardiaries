He can't complain about the increasing number of Japanese eating our rice, so he blames the war for our inability to import it.</p>								<p>Laurel creates the "Civilian Protection Service" to adopt protective measures against air raids.  The Japanese have prohibited the public from going out on the streets during air raids.</p>								<p>Public Pulser Syuzan, a "Japanese resident of Manila," calls the rumor of Japanese planes painted in American colors, "groundless, preposterous, and silly," thus adding wings to said rumor.</p>								<p>Primco has sealed the stores of the Landahls, Awad, and others.  Several employees of Elizalde have been sent to Fort Santiago for questioning.  Recto, Elizalde's ex-counselor, has been making strong but futile efforts to get them all released.  After all, if the Spanish Ambassador can get all the Spaniards out, the P.I. Foreign Minister ought to have at least a little pull, no?  'Tis even said that Recto is hopping mad and threatening to resign.  Meanwhile, no one can confirm if Madrigal is in or out.</p>								<p>Teodoro "the Great" Garcia is at the PGH after a narrow escape from death.  He felt a sudden pain at the Seamen's Training Institute.  General Kuroda offered his car to take him to Sternberg then to the PGH where the doctors examined him and promptly forgot about his case.  He had an operation on Wednesday — after his appendix had burst.  The Japanese were generous in providing him with critical and expensive medicines.  One of them loudly criticized the PGH as a "rotten hospital" — no doubt comparing it with Sternberg.  I was at the PGH today; it was crowded, short of this and that, and struggling to make ends meet.</p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
