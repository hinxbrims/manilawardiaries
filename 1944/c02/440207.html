There was no shortage of opinions, but no one really knew why they were picked up.</p>								<p>The Japanese Navy pounced on The Imperial Shirt Factory, saying they needed its 12 machines.  Worth about P50,000 to P60,000; the Navy took them for P3,700.</p>								<p>Benito Razon sold his black, shiny limousine — a Packard Clipper 120 — for P30,000 a bit too quickly to a buyer representing the Japanese Navy.  He thinks he could've gotten P40,000, but he was lucky.  Soon after, the Navy told a lady that they'd have her Packard Clipper 180 — much better than Benito's — <i>so please give us a price</i>.  Unaware of the previous transaction, she only asked for P25,000.  The Navy paid her P7,000 and took the car.</p>								<p>When hundreds showed up with food baskets in front of Santo Tomas yesterday, the Japanese relented and allowed them in.  So everyone returned again today, including us with a cake for the Connors.  This time the Japanese were adamant.  The camp is officially sealed — only laundry is allowed in.</p>								<p>Santo Tomas is still serving only two meals per day.  The Japanese were clever in one way: they let all the money enter the camp — about P1,000,000 — and now they can sweep it up by charging for extra food.  Rice, by the way is now up to P280 per sack from P250 a week ago.</p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
