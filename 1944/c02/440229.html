Up to the morning of February 23, 200 naval planes hit Saipan, Tinian and Guam, but "fled eastward."  Damage was "slight."  Manilans were not impressed at the late announcements or the omission of Kwajalein and Luot from the Tribune's map of the Central Pacific.</p>								<p>Commentator: "A juicy lure of islets in the Marshalls and five warships were too strong a temptation for [Nimitz] to resist, and in his avarice, he deservedly lost a big fleet of newly constructed vessels on that fateful sea off the Ladrones."  He speaks of the Japanese fleet as waiting in ambush.</p>								<p>Barnett, one of the Santo Tomas buyers before the camp was sealed, is in Fort Santiago.  The Japanese want to know who's selling to Santo Tomas on credit.  Many Manila firms are in a frightful panic.</p>								<p>News: Mountbatten announced the defeat of the Japanese forces that tried to encircle the 14th and 7th Divisions.  The Japanese suffered 1,000 killed and 2,000 wounded; British losses were "immeasurably lighter."  The current Newsreel No. 17, "On to Delhi," clearly states the objectives were Chittagong and Delhi.  The propaganda people will have a hard time explaining this.</p>								<p></p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
