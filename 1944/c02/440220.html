He is supposed to feel "uneasy over the possible outcome."  The word "atoll" is used three times.  The much-bragged about Japanese <i>naval base</i> in Truk is now a mere <i>atoll</i>.</p>								<p>The Burma offensive gets six lines in a corner of page 1: "Nippon forces occupy two hills."</p>								<p>Back-pedaling furiously, Maharajah (Icasiano) concedes that not all Buy and Sell dealers made a killing, that there were some honest people in the Economic Police, and that Real Estate Brokers were not part of the Buy and Sell crowd.</p>								<p>The exodus to the provinces, even by those with steady jobs, continues.  Living costs here are impossible.  A rice ration of only 60 grams per day is insufficient, if you can get it.  Rice is P10 a ganta here but 25c in Vigan — and that's already five times prewar.  Even so, it's said that rice from Zambales and the Cagayan Valley is strictly for the Japanese Army.  It's a favor, you see, because we can't transport it and they obviously can.</p>								<p>Our railroads are in such a poor state — cars pulled by locomotives that belong in the Smithsonian — that passengers, if allowed, can hardly take any luggage.  Yet what a splash the Japanese made when the lines reopened.  What will the poor eat when all transportation into Manila stops?  Well-to-do families have, on average, a three-month reserve of food; the poor have nothing.</p>								<p>Everyday, one sees kids walking around with great sores on their skinny legs — the effect of mosquito bites on malnourished bodies.  A bit of camote with diluted lugao is not enough to sustain a body — and that's third-class rice; the Japanese Cavalry horses get <i>Ilon-Ilon</i>.  The best rice goes to the Japanese Navy, followed by the Japanese Army, their Cavalry horses, and finally, whatever's left is ours.</p>								<div class="image right" style="width: 268; margin-top: 2px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 5px">					<img src="nipponbazaar.png" border="0" width="268" height="234" alt="nipponbazaar">					<div class="caption" style="margin-top: 4px">					Nippon Bazaar					</div>				</div>								<p>Against all this, the government stands powerless.  It talks of encouraging people to go to the provinces, but does nothing.  As for the Japanese, it's our problem — we're independent, you see?  Manilans haven't tasted sugar for sixty days, but Mr. Matsura of the Nippon Bazaar has sacks of it in reserve.  He has a dokar and three horses — their food sweetened with pure refined sugar because <i>pulot</i> [raw sugar syrup] and <i>panocha</i> [dry raw sugar] is unavailable.</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
