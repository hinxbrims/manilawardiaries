Elsewhere, a number of Japanese engagements were weak: An attack on <a href="../../mapper/pac/pac_bismarcks.html">Borgen Bay</a><sup>†</sup> on February 4 only "damaged a medium-sized transport"; the squadron that bombed a convoy between New Britain and New Guinea didn't hit a thing; and B-24's over Thailand were "routed," but none were downed.  A far cry from Bougainville where they claimed 14 planes sank two carriers and four or five cruisers.</p>								<p>"Film on P.I. Campaign to be presented to Laurel" — titled "Tear Down the Stars and Stripes."  Attempting to turn propaganda into history, Lt. Gen. Nara says the picture <i>proves</i> the Japanese fought against the U.S. and not Filipino troops.</p>								<p>Who's who in Fort Santiago: Yesterday, Mr. and Mrs. Jimenez and Mrs. Santamaria were released at 1800.  Ozamiz was taken in.  He passed me in his dokar that morning — I remember thinking he could have given me a lift.  Enrique Santamaria and Mosa came out this evening.  Many are saying that Madrigal is in!</p>								<p>A Swiss with Nestlé had a friendly Japanese officer for a neighbor.  The officer, now on his way south after returning to Japan for several months, advised the Swiss: "Get out of Manila — and soon!"  So the Swiss is chartering a truck to go to Baguio.  Another Swiss is going too; several Germans and third party nationals are already there.</p>								<p>One Lt. Mamoto admitted to a friend that the Japanese were suffering incredible hardships in New Guinea due to a lack of food.  He felt guilty because he thought he had divulged a military secret by talking about the Lipa airfield in Batangas — a gigantic construction effort that everyone knows about.</p>								<p>By radio: The whole Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshalls is in U.S. hands after nine days and 15,000 tons of bombs and shells!  It looks like the U.S. will not take every island, but leave a few Japanese behind to wither on the vine.</p>								<p class="footnote"><sup>† </sup>Borgen Bay faces north in the western edge of the island of New Britain.</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
