The hub of a carretela hit a Japanese officer, sending him sprawling, though uninjured.  He rose immediately and bellowed for the cochero to stop.  The cochero didn't, or couldn't stop his unruly horse.  Incensed, the officer stopped the next three carretelas and bade the cocheros and passengers to line up.  Unsheathing his sword, he gave each of the nine a slash on the skin below the knee.  A couple of them shrieked.  Three fell.  All bled.  Our Japanese hero sauntered off, happy to have saved the honor of his flag and country.</p>								<p>Tribune: "Enemy Attack Force Repulsed off Truk....  Nippon garrisons maintain positions on island intact."  Astonishingly, the Japanese admit losing two cruisers, three destroyers, 13 transports, 120 planes, plus "some damage on the ground."  The American planes had a picnic the second day and must have taken some very revealing photographs.</p>								<p>"Tojo, Shimada Assume Staff Chief Posts."  Major General Sugiyama and Fleet Admiral Nagano are out; Tojo and Shimada are bound to be more aggressive.</p>								<p>Commentator on the rumor of Japanese planes painted with American insignia: <i>"What a devilishly ingenious scheme!  A satanic plot of its kind is worse than a crime....  We cannot forgive the Americans from such a premeditated massacre from the air with a well-prepared alibi."</i></p>								<p>"Reich bombers blast London" â€” but not a word of the 6,000 planes over Germany in the last 36 hours.</p>								<p>News: The pace of destruction of the Axis war machine is accelerating.  Germany got 9,000-tons of bombs in the last 48 hours alone compared to 52,000-tons in the whole of 1942.  The first 21 days of February saw the invincible Japanese lose 94 ships, including 10 warships, plus 585 planes.</p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
