				<p class="first">Tribune: "Enemy loses 4 warships, 76 planes in Marshalls....  Nippon firmly defending islands....  Army Navy garrisons repulse landing forces in Kwajalein and Luot [Roi]" — false on all points.</p>
				
				<p>"Next rations due next week" — for January and February.  What will we get over and above a single month's rations?  A box of matches.  As for sugar, we'll get none because it's "still under study."</p>
				
				<p>Page 2 (from Tokyo): "Japan is extending to interned enemy nationals a fair and just treatment based on International Law so as not to disgrace Japan's honor."  Seems Vice-Minister Yamamoto toured and visited the internment camps.  One Fujisoku Tanaka "was convinced that internees are being treated by Japan too generously as compared with ill-treatment meted out to Japanese internees in enemy countries."</p>
				
				<p>"Why be jobless?"  Manila needs 1,650 men, Cebu needs 100, and Davao and Zamboanga apparently need an unlimited number of men — they're paying P7 daily for carpenters.</p>
				
				<p>Editorial: "Anti-Axis kills 17 nuns" — about bombings in Italy.  It begins: "After going to Holy Mass this morning...."  What he's getting at is that if nuns, churches, hospitals, and even the Holy Father get bombed, what hope does Manila have?</p>
				
				<p>Maharajah says the smartest profiteers are not Filipinos:</p>
				
				<blockquote>The Jews, Chinese, the Indians have all the best dokars, the best horses, the best women ... and what do most Filipinos here and in the provinces do about it?  They try to kill one another in the name of patriotism.</blockquote>

				<p>He mixes up profiteering and inflation.  The masses, on a mission of self-preservation, were the real profiteers.  The Filipinos were first, second and third; the Chinese, fourth; the Jews are a mere handful, and the Indians who made money were merchants with stock to begin with.</p>
				
				<p>News: Kwajalein and Luot taken — a walkover.  Mili, Wake, Burma, Wewak and Madang were bombed.</p>
				
				<p>Juan Miguel Elizalde won't be celebrating his birthday today.  Last night, Enrico Pirovano hosted an impromptu party at the <a href="../../mapper/ermita.html">Elena Apartments</a>, which mostly houses high ranking Japanese officers.  Among the attendees were Elizalde and wife, Mr. and Mrs. Corominas, Jimenez, Mosa (No.1 Elizalde employee), Palomares of the BPI, and Father Rufino Santos (the Archbishop's Secretary), and others.  Hans Menzi, his sister Margot, and the Santamarias arrived well after curfew.  The Japanese surrounded the building at 0130 then burst in and picked them all up, including the servants.  Manolo Elizalde was picked up too, but from his house.</p>
