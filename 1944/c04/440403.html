Mayor orders arrests for infractions" â€” nothing about the <i>why</i> of the blackout "alerts".  He specifically fingered third-party nationals as not complying with the orders.  This is strictly incorrect; third party nationals know they're on the spot and are the most careful of all.  Japanese civilians, knowing it was just practice and not giving a hang about it, were the worst offenders for the first two nights.
