We only found out when Maurice returned at 2030 last night and told us to blackout partially.</p>								<p>Tomorrow, on the occasion of the Emperor's birthday, Santo Tomas is allowed to cautiously throw open its doors to only the closest blood relatives — and packages will be allowed.</p>								<p>The International Neutral's Committee under Janssen, the Swedish Consul, has permission to send food to Santo Tomas internees as well as to prisoners.  So 2,100 eggs and 400 liters of milk are going in today for the children.  Tomorrow 800 kilos of beef and hundreds of chickens will go in.  The Japanese emphasized that this is a "special and temporary privilege" — to celebrate the Emperor's birthday.  There's hope that Father Theo, the Elizaldes, Pirovano and others will be pardoned too.</p>								<p>When Enrique Santamaria was in, he was asked about his giving much money to the Camps. "Yes, how not," he said.  "My partner is in, my wife's relatives too, and some business associates and friends."  As a gentleman and a neutral Spaniard, he said he was duty-bound to do what he could, and would do the same for his Japanese friends under similar circumstances.  He then rattled off the names of several Japanese friends.  The Japanese were pleased and let him out.</p>								<p>News: MacArthur's troops took the third Hollandia airfield today.</p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
