The work is not hard ... it actually makes the time pass faster."  The camp's band, glee clubs and dramatic society help break up the monotony of camp life with twice-weekly shows.  Joe received a note with P100 from Maurice, and should be receiving mine any day now.  He also got a nine-pound package of food and vitamins from Paul and Mary in the States through the Japanese Red Cross.  It's the first we've heard from our second brother, Paul, for a while.  And if this wasn't enough good news for the day, the younger Adamson saw a list of 300 American POWs to be sent to Japan and a partial list of those staying — Joe was on the latter!</p>								<p>Tribune: "Strongest British Outpost Captured" — Chikka, along the India-Burma border.  "Three enemy divisions encircled following occupation of Tammu."  The Japanese are great at these encircling maneuvers but that's all they can manage to accomplish.  It's become a war of attrition that the outnumbered, outgunned and under-supplied Japanese can't win.</p>								<p>Maharajah informs us that "so-called 'Texas' gangs" are operating against railway lines north and south of Manila, menacing peace and order, and retarding the "necessary economic development" of the country.  He means, of course, that they are retarding the Japanese movement of equipment.</p>								<p>Palau News: The Japanese lost 160 planes (a further 50 probably damaged) and 28 ships including a battleship.  American losses: 27 planes and "no naval losses" — though some might have been damaged.</p>								<p>La Vanguardia: "Roxas presides over new Economic Planning Board" [EPB].</p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
