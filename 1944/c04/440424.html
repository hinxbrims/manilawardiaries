Three Japanese guards and the Filipino driver were killed; the jitney tossed over a precipice.  Another jitney left recently — this time fully escorted by a convoy of vehicles.</p>								<p class="center">. . . .</p>								<p>One outspoken Japanese said the worst mistake they made was to plant cotton — they should have continued with sugar.  At that time they had such a large stock of sugar they figured it was enough.  The cotton grew to a foot or so in height and gave no flowers.</p>								<p class="center">. . . .</p>								<p>The Japanese garrison that first entered Tarlac found thousands of sacks of refined sugar in the bodegas.  They bayoneted many sacks and gorged themselves.  One enterprising soldier, spying some magnificent thoroughbred steeds, jumped on the grandest and got the ride of his life.  The horse bolted into a barbed wire fence, gashing its shoulders badly and catapulting our hapless rider straight into hospital.  The troops sobered up and moved on to their fates in Bataan.</p>								<p class="center">. . . .</p>								<p>A Filipino working for a newspaper said the Japanese doing propaganda work sometimes smirked audibly when reading Daihon-ei communiqués.  Are they smirking at the version they'll have to feed us?  Nope, they don't believe a word from Daihon-ei!</p>								<p class="center">...oOo...</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
