Gratitude Mission" — and "Aquino is granted Rescript."  This was meant to be an economic mission, but they are being banqueted, decorated, audienced and feted to death.</p>								<p>"Manilans will continue receiving rice rations" — many applied for permits.  Roxas is the hero of the hour again.  Some feel he can get the guerrillas to lift their blockade; others say the transportation problem remains unsolved.</p>								<p>"Commissioner clears Nippon-P.I. relations in talk with Datu."  Paulino Santos met with Datu Salipada Pendatum — "an active guerilla leader, first lieutenant in the USAFFE and ex-member of the provincial board of Cotabato."  The Tribune prints the Datu's provocative questions; Santos answers like Saito.</p>								<p>Commentator: "British forces in India hovering between annihilation and surrender."  Actually, the Japanese have been pushed back 30 miles.</p>								<p>A Constabulary man was killed in Santa Mesa and a search was on when I got off the bantam jitney.  Instead of joining the line, I sauntered up a path leading to Manga Avenue and avoided the search.  A Japanese officer, Constabulary officer, plus two men with rifles were so intent on watching the search that they missed me.  Fifty yards away, twenty others formed a perimeter in case anyone tried to escape.  It's getting to be pretty hot for officers of the law.  So far, no judge has imposed the death penalty on those caught with unlicensed firearms.  Can't say I blame them — who'd like to be a marked man today?</p>								<p>I talked to an internal revenue agent, who is also a leader of a Neighborhood Association group and the rice distributor for the district.  "<i>A thankless job</i>," I suggested.</p>								<p class="dialogA">"Well, not so bad.  You see," he said in a confidential manner, "we get thirty extra rations."</p>								<p class="dialogB">"How so, isn't it dangerous?"</p>								<p class="dialogA">"Fictitious names."  Then with a shrug from his shoulders, he explained that the President of the district told him to do it.  "He's got it figured that if I'm investigated, the investigation will have to be done by himself."</p>								<p>I had a good day — closed a P50,000 deal — and talked with the President (Campos) and VP of the BPI.</p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
