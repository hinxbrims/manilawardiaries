Dr. Baylon did the operation today.  The anesthesia was no good (locally made) and Maurice suffered plenty of pain — all told it took fifty minutes instead of the usual twenty.  Only the best room at the clinic was available — marvelous at P70 per day.</p>								<p>Tribune: "President Greets Emperor's Birthday [43rd] on behalf of P.I."</p>								<p>"Nippon sub torpedoes enemy aircraft carrier" — heavily damaged and <i>believed</i> sunk after two hits.  The usual in Burma: They captured two or three hills near Palel in the last three or four weeks, and lost many more that they won't talk about.</p>								<p>"Charges against F.A. agents dropped" — due to insufficient evidence.  Almost all the complaints against government inspectors and agents are bona fide, but almost all of the cases are dropped for want of <i>enough</i> evidence.</p>								<p>La Vanguardia: "Aquino relates impressions of present visit to Japan."  He praises the Japanese spirit as Japan's "most cherished treasure," which is true enough, but he adds: "By virtue of this spirit Japan will continue to prosper forever."  All because the middle class family he visited with said everything's fine.</p>								<p>"Rice can't be brought by train" — and therein lies a tale.  Many who obtained licenses to bring rice in were depending on the train, but the Japanese won't allow it.  Remember when Laurel asked them to turn over transportation to the Filipinos?  That was the last time he asked.  It's obvious that he's taking orders — not giving them.</p>								<p>A Japanese bomber crashed taking off from Nichols two days ago.  The rumor yesterday said it was an arriving transport with, perhaps, Terauchi on board.</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
