No one here ever believed that nonsense in the past; if the Japanese ever use that phrase again they'll roar with laughter.  The story is: 1) NO Japanese air force and ineffective anti-aircraft; 2) There was TREMENDOUS DAMAGE; 3) ONLY military objectives were attacked and they were PRECISELY hit.  Here in Manga Avenue, we were as safe as if we'd been in New York.</p>								<p>All we've seen in Manila are the effects of part of this task force; no doubt Legaspi, Bulan, Pili, Tarlac and Lipa were hit some days ago.  Japanese air strength in the Philippines has been practically wiped out.  It wasn't a CONTEST but a ROUT — a humiliating drubbing.</p>								<p>The <i>Air Raid</i> siren went on again at <b>1650</b>, and the <i>Alert</i> sounded 45 minutes later, but no planes appeared.  I don't expect them in this weather.  The winds are strong now and the barometer is threatening to enter the <em>Typhoon-At-A-Distance</em> bracket.  Julio Kaufmann just told me that Martial Law was declared at 0900.  I had gone downtown without even knowing it!</p>								<p>Nimitz: Halsey's Third Fleet raids concentrated on Manila.  In the beginning they had to fight off an "umbrella" of Japanese planes; later, the Japanese were off the map after having lost 110 planes in the air and 90 on the ground.  Sunk were 11 Japanese ships including a large destroyer and 5 oilers, while 26 other vessels were heavily damaged, destroyed or "probably destroyed."  American losses were 15 planes and no ships damaged.  Incidentally, the Japanese here are saying that they sank three American carriers and a battleship.</p>								<p><b>Martial Law</b>: Stripped of technicalities, it means the Japanese Army and Navy get "absolute authority" — the end of the Philippine Republic in Manila.  The Tribune says Laurel gets all the power, but not if you read between the lines.  Why martial law at all?  The Japanese are fed up with the conventions of society and legalities.  They are fed up with Laurel, his government, the bothersome "Housing Committee," the "petty" protests of house owners, and the slackers among the forced labor gangs.  Under Martial Law they can clear any district, enter and take any house no-questions-asked!  Yessiree, the rough ride begins now.</p>								<p style="text-align: right" class="inLink"><a href="440922e.html"> continues...</a></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
