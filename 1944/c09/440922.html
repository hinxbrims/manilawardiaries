The air-raid siren went on at <b>0715</b>, and local stations again went off the air.  American planes arrived 25 minutes later to a hot reception.  It's great bombing weather, a bit misty but visibility is good.  Good for antiaircraft too — the planes are easy to spot under the white clouds.</p>								<p>I saw about eight planes diving.  I followed two pairs coming from the east, clearly visible and ideal targets for the antiaircraft for a full 60 seconds.  They split over San Juan; one pair headed for Nichols while the other went for Murphy or the <a href="../../mapper/sanjuan.html">Pinaglabanan</a> munitions dump.  I lost sight of them when they flipped over and dived.</p>								<p>A bit later I saw some beautiful dive-bombing over the Port Area.  Every time I saw a plane dive out of sight I found myself thinking: <em>That's enough now ... pull up, pull up</em>.  I couldn't see how they could possibly miss their targets, or how the antiaircraft could miss them.  This time, there was a clear difference between the sound of bombs and antiaircraft, but the antiaircraft, though severe, seemed ineffective, and no Japanese fighters rose to challenge the dive-bombers or the fighters patrolling above them.</p>								<p><b>0830</b>: We're still under air raid conditions.  The <i>Air Raid</i> signal is a wavy siren.  Two 30-second-blasts means <i>Alert</i>; a 90-second-blast means <i>All Clear</i>.  The Japanese always go from <i>Air Raid</i> to <i>Alert</i> before an <i>All Clear</i> — never directly.  We were on <i>Alert</i> all of last night.  I doubt if we'll get an <i>All Clear</i> today or tomorrow.</p>								<p><b>0857</b>: They're here again — flying low.  There goes the siren ... needless now.  Ma called me to the front of the house where I counted 29 and later 3 more dive-bombers in formations of 3's.  They were clearly visible, and although antiaircraft sounded heavy, I couldn't even see a puff though I did hear a Japanese pom-pom for the first time.  The planes split in ALL directions and hit their targets with the heaviest bombs so far.  The concussion waves were easily felt — our house really shook.  Some planes headed for the Bataan-Olongapo sector while others hit <a href="../../mapper/murphy.html">Camp Murphy</a> and the Port Area — the latter especially hard.  The Port Area is jammed with vital war materials that the Japanese have been unable to move due to a lack of transportation.</p>								<p style="text-align: right" class="inLink"><a href="440922b.html"> continues...</a></p>								<p></p>								<p></p>								<blockquote></blockquote>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
