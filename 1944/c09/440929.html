"<i>Gangway</i>," I said throwing politeness aside, "<i>I'm on my way home</i>."  When I reached Manga Avenue my fears were confirmed.  Two large wooden barriers were on the street and two Japanese sentries stood at each side with fixed bayonets.  I walked up, bowed, showed my residence certificate and pointed to our house — the second one on the left.  The sentry had strict orders: "<em>No one to enter</em>."  He indicated I was to go around the long way through Altura.  I insisted but he was adamant.  I went via Piña through the Siy house.</p>								<p>Once at Manga Avenue, Dr. Monching Ayesa, Anita Feltman and others told me the Kempeitai were having a meeting at the Alberto's, and half the residents of Manga Avenue were there.  The upshot was this: The Japanese would content themselves with five houses on Manga Avenue and "guarantee" us safety from ouster if we agreed to "take in" the five families rendered homeless by the act.  We all breathed a sigh of relief but asked for guarantees, which they refused, but they were profuse in promises to protect as against the army and navy.</p>								<p>So it seems the lower half of Manga Avenue is to be the Kempeitai's "enlarged headquarters," and we will be given special passes to enter Manga Avenue; <em>no one else will be allowed in.</em>  The Menzis, Bessmers and Bernards intend to protest through French Consul Lerocque, but I think they've been definitely blitzed.  Touch wood — and wait — at least a little longer.</p>								<p>News: The radio report on the second carrier task force raid on the Visayas was worth waiting for: 22 ships sunk and 43 damaged, of which 15 are probably sunk.  A further 20 to 30 small vessels were destroyed.  The Americans lost ten planes, but only five pilots and three other personnel are missing.  The Japanese put up seven planes and lost the lot.  I make it 1,411 planes and 294 ships lost by the Japanese in September; twice the shipping lost than in their worst previous month.</p>								<p></p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
