A Japanese Captain and two officers came to see our house.  One was polite and spoke good English.  So I blitzed him, at least for today.  I gave them the low-down: All the houses in Manga Avenue were under the protection of the Kempeitai.  We had two meetings with them and agreed to cooperate.  They have three houses here and are taking another five to establish their <i>big headquarters</i>.  At their request, we agreed to house the ousted five families, in recognition of which, and for our sacrifices and cooperation, they have guaranteed to protect our houses.  I poured it on thick as he translated.</p>								<p>They argued for ten minutes, occasionally asking a question.  <i>There had been a meeting, yes?</i>  Yes, two meetings in fact.  He translated.  <i>I was present at the meeting, yes?</i>  Oh yes, we <em>all</em> were; the Military Police had <em>called</em> each and every one of us.  He translated.  <i>How many Military Police were at the meeting?</i>  Two at the second, I'm not sure about the first.  He translated.  <i>Did I know, personally, any of them?</i>  No, (thinking fast) but one was a <em>Major</em> (thus outranking the "Captain" in front of me).  His name was actually Kunishi, but I think his rank was lower.)  He translated again.  <i>Would I point out the houses taken please?</i>  I said the Military Police could inform them.  Even now, I added, we were expecting a family to move in with us.  Furniture was already arriving.  We would all be very crowded in Manga Avenue.  He translated; they argued.</p>								<p>"<i>You see</i>," said the interpreter, "<i>er ... the Captain here is from Malacañan ... this is OFFICIAL ... and, er ... the Military Police, er ... did not do this, er ... did not inform us.  Our Captain is in charge of housing</i>"!</p>								<p>I remained silent because a little glimmer of light was showing.  The Military Police had blitzed their Embassy out of Manga Avenue.  The interpreter asked to be allowed to see the house.  Only then did I unlock the door.  As we entered, Altwegg was on the phone.  "<em>Don't give 'em any information</em>," he said, "<em>send them to the Military Police</em>."  I intercepted them as they tried to enter the house — they were on the porch.  "<i>How many live here?</i>" asked the interpreter.  "<em>I don't know how many will — we have agreed to take into our houses the five families ... then there was my brother's family, plus relatives in Pasay who are coming</em>."</p>								<p>One entered my room from the porch; two others joined him, standing right under my aerial!  My mother intercepted them and set the Japs back for a loss.  I remembered Altwegg: "<em>I suggest you see the Military Police</em>," I said.</p>								<p>They stared down, thoughtfully.  Four of Linda's puppies were there.  The captain picked up the best one.  The interpreter asked: "<i>Can we have one?</i>"  Sure, I replied with relief, not knowing Mrs. Guttridge was to take that particular one.  They left shortly afterwards, ostensibly to see the Military Police, but Altwegg told me later that they stopped short and aborted their mission.  Saved again.</p>								<p>And that's the story of why we are still in our house.  The Kempeitai "took" Manga Avenue before the embassy or the army "arrived."  The Navy took Santa Mesa two days ago, jolting the Army, which up to then had everything going their way.  So the Army began to move, having discovered that it didn't pay to go about things officially.  But the Kempeitai, the smallest but most powerful group, had moved first.  Late today, a complication arose because the Kempeitai wanted a few rooms tonight in the houses to be taken, despite promising to give the families ten days to move.</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
