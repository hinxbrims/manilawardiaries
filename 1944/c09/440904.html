After the usual airfields, the Americans hit shipyards and warehouses too, starting large fires.  Three planes went down — all Japanese.</p>								<p>Had a fine lunch at Pacifico's office today with Penny.  We had a good talk and a fine time.</p>								<p>I remember looking askance at a Chinese merchant not too long ago for asking P1.75 for a packet of Wrigley PKs.  Well, one packet sold for P20 today — P4 per candy!  When I mentioned this to Mrs. Menzi, she got up and gave me 3 packs of PKs of her late husband, God Rest His Soul!  It still tastes the same though the aged coating has lost some of its hardness.</p>								<p>Rice has hit P1,600 a sack.  The papers won't mention it because the authorities hope the price will fall soon.  One of Laurel's arguments against declaring war on the Americans is that it would touch off a civil war in the provinces and prevent the harvest — clever because the Japanese have to eat too.</p>								<p>PIAM totally defeated a friend of mine today.  He stomached the tripe until the announcer said that Germany, far from being beaten, was actually stronger than ever before!  Hard to stomach too is the constant Japanese bellyaching: <i>Does a bomb fall on them?  Mama ... barbarians are attacking us!  Quick, get me the International Law Regulations on Bombing.  They dropped some bombs on a coconut grove and killed the Divisional Commander!  I ask you, is that legal?  Why bomb a coconut grove?  Why hurt the poor nuts?  Aren't these guys devils?  Imagine too, they killed a native ... such barbarians!  They left a woman and child without a father!  See?  See?  Didn't we tell you?</i></p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
