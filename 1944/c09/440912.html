That's why the Japanese are scrambling to move into the residential areas of Manila, eh?  But if they really did hit a hospital or a church, which I doubt, then they <em>did</em> hit military stores.</p>								<p>Police Notes: "The body of a 19-year old youth greeted church and market-goers last Sunday in Azcarraga Street near Ylaya ... clothed in rags, thin and emaciated."  Must've died of plain starvation.  Food prices are skyrocketing out of control.  Rice is near P3,000; even lowly corn, which was at P500 recently, tripled in the last two weeks.</p>								<p>Editorial: The U.S. forced the Japanese to mass men here to provide a "very adequate" defense for our sake.  If inconveniences are caused, why, we should be happy to bear them because the Japanese will defend our "liberty" to the "last man."</p>								<p>News: Halsey's Task Force raid on Mindanao destroyed sixty planes on the ground and eight out of eight in the air.  They hit airfields and installations on Buayan (southern tip), Valencia (eastern tip), Del Monte, Cagayan and Davao.  Warships and planes off <a href="../../_maps/philregions.html">Hinatuan Bay</a> (northeastern tip) wiped out an unprotected convoy of 32 loaded motor vessels and 20 sampans.  Another 20 more were damaged in the Davao Gulf and Sarangani Bay (southern tip).  U.S. losses were "very light."  Mindanao is being cleared.</p>								<p></p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
