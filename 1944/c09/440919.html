As I walked up the bridge on my way home a shower caught me.  Reaching Manga Avenue soaked, I ducked into the Garriz house, now occupied by a Japanese working for PIAM, and sheltered under the front stair.  A voice went, "Come in."  I turned and saw a Japanese with a thin moustache and nervous mien.  He indicated the steps so I sat on the fourth step.  He sat five steps above mine so I joined him there.</p>			<p class="dialogB">"Got an office downtown?" he asked.</p>			<p class="dialogA">"Well, no, but I'm doing a little business, nevertheless."</p>			<p class="dialogB">"Doing well?"</p>			<p class="dialogA">"Enough for these difficult times," I answered.</p>			<p>That gave him the opening he desired, so he launched into a well-rehearsed, often used line.</p>			<p class="dialogB">"Ah, the war, y'know.  I remember 1915, 16, 17...I was in New York then, y'know?  Pretty tough."</p>			<p>He shook his head meaningfully, smacked his lips and took a puff of his cigarette.  I decided not to tell him I spent several years in New York too.</p>			<p class="dialogB">"Yes," he went on, "I remember sugar, for instance.  Prices went up and up.  First they rationed you to three cubes a cup, then two, then a half, ha-ha-ha.  I couldn't stand coffee then."</p>			<p>I thought about how the Swiss learned to get by without sugar in the last war, and how some still drink coffee without it.  And of the Filipinos without any ration, and no sugar at all.  He was doubtless using a lot of sugar in his coffee now.  The Japanese have a lot of our sugar; only we don't.  He was blissfully ignorant of my thoughts, so I sized him up as he went on.</p>			<p class="dialogB">"America is all right; good country, but oh, too imperialistic ... and race discrimination.  In Brazil it's much better.  Yeh, I was in Brazil too.  Went there in 1940 with 120 Japanese families.  We founded a colony, y'know ... 300 miles in the interior.  Previous to that I was in Hollywood.  I was an actor, y'know?" — he said proudly.</p>			<p class="dialogA">"Good country, Brazil.  Good future, South America," I said, but he seemed more interested in comparing people for his propaganda work.</p>			<p class="dialogB">"Yeh, Brazilians' all right.  Nice country.  Materialistic though, just like the Americans, but they practice democracy.  In contrast Americans talk democracy but don't practice it.  In America they mistreat Negroes, and there's more of them every year.  In 100 years there's going to be as many as the whites.  In Brazil they treat everybody equal, and there's less Negroes now than before.  Ah, the Americans should learn...they can't stop fate so why not take it the right way?"</p>			<p>I steered the conversation towards the fertility of its land and climate.  We chatted a bit more and eventually he snapped out of it.</p>			<p class="dialogB">"Yes, yes, pretty good, Brazil.  I'm going there after this war."</p>			<p>Just then some Spaniards passed by Manga Avenue, and when a lady saw me talking to him up the stairs, her eyebrows performed a somersault — or was it my imagination?  The rain was slackening.  I stood up.</p>			<p class="dialogA">"Well, thanks," I said.</p>			<p class="dialogB">"Not at all, not at all."</p>			<p>No doubt a lonely chap, I figured as I trudged home.  Bet he'd like to be in Hollywood right now.</p>				</td>			</tr>		</table>	</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer2">		<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="710" align="left">			<tr align="center">				<td align="center" valign="top" width="55">					&nbsp;				</td>				<td align="center" valign="top" width="200">					&nbsp;				</td>				<td align="center" valign="top" width="246">				<br><span class="inLink"><a href="#p1">- Top -</a></span>				</td>								<td align="center" valign="top" width="209">					&nbsp;				</td>			</tr>		</table>	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
