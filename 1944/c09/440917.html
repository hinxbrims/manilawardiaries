It's the lamest, tamest article the Japanese have ever printed, with no sensationalism, cries of foul, or slanderous remarks.  It doesn't say how many planes were in the raid or the damage they caused.  It's obvious why: we'll soon have eyewitness reports to verify the results.  If it happened in China, or if the report was meant for Tokyo, damage would have been "negligible."</p>								<p>Radio Tokyo admitted that American forces landed in Angaur Island, adjacent to Peleliu.  In Morotai, the Japanese claim Americans are meeting "stiff resistance," while the Americans say there was practically no opposition — not a single Japanese plane.</p>								<p>San Francisco said Radio Tokyo announced an evacuation of civilians from Davao!  Doesn't it sound nice and simple?  It's common place in this war, no?  Not in the Philippines!!  The provinces are areas miles from nowhere, certainly miles from the Philippine Government.  Outside of already-crowded provincial capitals is wilderness, mountains and long winding roads leading to small widely scattered towns.  How could they get there without transportation, and where would they find shelter AND food?  Even Japanese soldiers are not getting enough to eat, which is why groups of 2, 4, and up to 6 are inviting themselves into people's homes.  The guerrillas might hold you up for food, but at least they won't come to eat on your table.</p>								<p>For two years we've been It-Can't-Happen-Here Happy-Go-Lucky guys, and such is the stuff we're made of, we still laugh and pretend it won't.  When it's just two or three of us, however, we are beginning to look at the facts, and they aren't good.</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
