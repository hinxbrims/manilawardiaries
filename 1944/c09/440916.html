Eight Grumman fighters swooped down over Ligao and strafed the Railroad Station and a train, seriously injuring four Filipinos, including a child.  Damage to the Ligao airfield isn't mentioned.</p>								<p>There's much talk here about guerrillas.  One Lt. Col. "Terry" heads the ROTC Hunters, also known as "Terry's Hunters."  One Col. Ramsey slipped out of Bataan and joined a guerilla unit — a substantial group that includes some Americans.  The "Marking" Guerrillas are named after its founder — a former truck driver of the Philippine Refining Company before the war.  Some blame him for Straughn's capture after a disagreement.  Remember Nakar?  He was turned in by a few Filipino traitors and executed at Fort Santiago.</p>								<p>Tired of all the detours and no-pass zones, some Filipinos and carretela drivers are getting past sentries by waving pieces of paper as if they were <em>passes</em>.  A friend of mine learned a few Japanese phrases, like "<em>May I pass please?</em>" and "<em>Thank you</em>."  The first time he tried it, the sentry sprang to attention, saluted, and roared defiance at the heavens, scaring everyone around and my friend — so eager he was to give him the whole street!</p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
