By then the Quiapo market was clean out of food and prices were already sharply up.  On my way home the rumormongers were at it.  One said a low flying American plane strafed Pureza; another said a Japanese plane strafed Teresa.  I arrived home to find no water on tap and the gas so poor that cooking was impossible.</p>								<p>1452: American planes are again overhead!  Antiaircraft is firing as the planes swoop in and out.  I can hear the bombs clearly now.  WOW!  As I sat down to write this at 1503 I felt two heavy thuds.  The Pandacan area is on fire — and it's tremendous.  Hell, it's terrific!  Well, I think it's Pandacan but it could be closer.  Hold it!  Anti-aircraft again ... I can see a plane diving on Camp Murphy.  I thought it had been shot down as it dove out of sight, but it reappeared a moment later.  There's another ... and yet another ... six planes.  The doors and windows of our house are rattling continuously now.</p>								<p>As I write this, barely a mile or two away I can see a huge Pandacan fire and feel its heat on my bare shoulders.  The noise is tremendous.  Ma worried that our house would catch fire; there's no water in Manila!  Explosion after explosion is coming from the direction of the National Development Building I think.  Only two days ago, I walked down Santa Mesa way and saw truck-after-truck taking munitions into the National Development Building.  If it's on fire there'll be nothing left of it tomorrow.  How marvelous it is to sit here feeling perfectly safe.</p>								<p>1512: Anti-aircraft fire is desultory.  The weather is good for bombing: high clouds but clear below with only a slight breeze.  The width of the fire continues to grow.  The pilots will have the satisfaction of being able to see the smoke all the way back to their carriers.  I must have seen at one time some 20 American planes and no antiaircraft explosions near them.</p>								<p>1526: My kingdom for a camera!  What a fire — the smoke is beginning to blanket Manila but the flames are clearly visible from here.  There goes another explosion ... antiaircraft is starting again.  I can hear planes in front of me now on the Bay side — bombing again.  It shook up the fire — it's now making loud crackling noises.</p>								<p></p>								<p></p>								<p style="text-align: right" class="inLink"><a href="440921c.html"> continues...</a></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!— ***************** FOOTER ***************** —>		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!— **************** NAVIGATOR **************** —></div>		</body></html>
