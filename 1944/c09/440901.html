It started with Lt. Hayashi; then the new Lt. Watanabe started to drop in and stay until he was fed, and now his underlings are tagging along.</p>								<p>Housing is still a headache.  The ousted Ortigas family started to move to the Olbes house only to find them being re-moved.  One family is still worrying after moving three times.  The Ygoas were given only 24 hours notice.  Count yourself lucky if the Japanese provide you with transportation or another house.  One family agreed to move but to a specific house.  Its occupants were promptly kicked out, vowing revenge after the war.  Delgado tried to double-cross Maurice, but the intended tenant, an interpreter named Ishimura, knew Mr. Sotelo before the war and agreed to lay-off.  For the moment, doubling-up with other families is proving to be one solution.</p>								<p>The Japanese are now storing oil and ammunition near hospitals and churches.  Given the dispersal of stores and the wholesale takeover of districts for military use, one might think that the destruction of Manila could now be justified, and if so, wouldn't it be better to evacuate?</p>								<p>This week the Japanese ended the privileges of the aged and infirm Americans at the Remedios and Hospicio de San Jose Hospitals.  Even the very sick are back in Santo Tomas.</p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div>	<!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">			<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="710" align="left">			<tr align="center">				<td align="center" valign="top" width="55">					&nbsp;				</td>				<td align="center" valign="top" width="200">					&nbsp;				</td>				<td align="center" valign="top" width="246">				<br><span class="inLink"><a href="#p1">- Top -</a></span>				</td>								<td align="center" valign="top" width="209">					&nbsp;				</td>			</tr>		</table>	</div>	<!-- ***************** PAGE 2 ***************** --><a name="p2"></a>	<div class="header2">		&nbsp;	</div>	<div class="main2">		<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="710" align="center">			<tr align="center">				<td align="center" valign="top" width="55">					&nbsp;				</td>				<td align="left" valign="top" width="655">			<div class="inLink">| <a href="#p1">Pg.1 Housing Crisis</a>| Pg.2 |</div>				<span class="date r">Supplement</span>				<span class="date">September 1, 1944</span>									<h3>A New Notebook<sup>†</sup></h3>														<p class="first">Today is the fifth Anniversary of the European War, and the date I'm marking as that of the Beginning of the Battle of the Philippines.</p>										<p>In which I begin a diary to cover the strenuous days ahead.
