Japanese planes were conspicuously absent except for the two <i>putt-putters</i>.  A few minutes after they passed, a lone Japanese plane flew back — its left undercarriage stuck halfway down, the pilot struggling to control his weaving craft.  It circled Nichols three full times before landing or crashing on the battered airfield.</p>								<p>Heavier bombs were used on Friday than on Thursday, probably because the carriers were nearer and the planes could carry less fuel.  Maurice saw drop-tanks flutter down like paper.</p>								<p>Walk into any house and there's only one topic of discussion.  You grow dizzy after five minutes of it, until you're swept in and find your own voice competing to relate your own experiences.  "<i>Now I really do believe the American communiqués — I have seen with my own eyes</i>," said one, eyes aglow, recalling flashes of scenes with pleasure and wonderment.  Everywhere, you can see people mimicking dive-bombers with their hands: they hold one hand up high and level, flip it over, zoom down and up, then spread both hands apart for the explosion.  This morning I saw four Japanese soldiers walking down the street with one of them doing the same — more in awe than enthusiasm.</p>								<p class="center">...ooOoo...</p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
