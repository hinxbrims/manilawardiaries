I ducked out to see if there were any carretelas in Buenos Aires as I wanted to buy some food.  There wasn't even a mouse on the street.  I decided to chance it at 1100.  I took my bike and two bayongs, and went out.  At least six fires were raging, three of them big.  No stores were open; sellers probably figure they can get better prices tomorrow.  The Sampaloc market was clean as a whistle so I went to Quiapo, stopping for bananas on the way at P1.00 each!  At Quiapo I even paid P35 for a clump of 18 — big ones though.  I was at Echague at 1135 when I heard the biggest explosion yet coming from the Port Area.  The few people about were too busy trying to buy food to get excited.  Someone pointed to the sky.  I looked up and saw smoke from the latest explosion going straight up in the air to a good altitude — all white like dynamite.</p>								<p>On the way back I ran into a lad who used to work for my brother Joe.  "<i>What's that fire over there?</i>" I asked.  "<em>Constabulary Headquarters</em>," he said.  I gulped.  My Dad's office building — a small and humble two-story building — is adjacent to it.  The Japanese occupied it long ago, paying one-tenth the rent it's worth today.  Later, a cochero confirmed the building took a direct hit.  Joe's lad told me that Pier 7 was a total wreck.  And that's something because Pier 7 is huge.  Japanese horizontal bombers missed it in 1941.</p>								<p><b>1230</b>: I heard a big explosion as I was having lunch at home.  At <b>1405</b>, another big explosion jolted me out of my <em>siesta</em>.  A few planes are high above the Port Area and there's some antiaircraft but the breeze is picking up and I expect it will end soon.</p>								<p>The <em>All Clear</em> sounded at <b>1505</b>, possibly skipping the <em>Alert</em>.  The weather worsened and it's starting to rain.  Secondary explosions are still coming from the Port Area.</p>								<p>In the middle of this short afternoon raid, two Japanese planes appeared — <em>putt-putters</em>, I call them — and barely cleared our roof with their 200-hp motors.  I watched them half-expecting the wind to tip 'em over anytime ... and that was all I saw of the Japanese Air Force today though I heard them warming up at 0200 or 0300 at Nichols, and again at 0600.</p>								<p style="text-align: right" class="inLink"><a href="440922d.html"> continues...</a></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
