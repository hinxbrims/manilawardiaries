Everyone guffawed at first, but that family is laughing now.  Being near an airbase, the Japanese are staying well away from their area.  Meanwhile, we here have to meet the formidable Japanese threat we now call: <i>The great Japanese housing offensive of September 1944</i>.</p>								<p>Some families forced to vacate committed minor acts of sabotage.  One Russian lady broke most of her windowpanes.  Another took the faucets and let the water run.  The place is still vacant save for a large number of frogs.</p>								<p>The propaganda arm delivers on Yonai's wished-for air superiority: "Nippon aircraft production is making strides."  Lt. Gen. Saburo Endo says it doubled this year.  (Of course, their losses tripled too.)</p>								<p>Late rumor: The Japanese will decide by Monday whether to take Manga Avenue or not.  It looks like they've vacated Dewey Boulevard after installing a number of antiaircraft guns there.  No doubt they think it wiser to move to a safer area like Santa Mesa â€” five kilometers from any military target.</p>								<p>A story doing the rounds is that 37 Fort Santiago detainees have been shot, including a batch involved in the Charles "Chick" Parsons spy ring recently rounded up.  The story started after Mrs. Ozamiz received all her husband's clothes.  It's said that Juan Elizalde and Pirovano were shot too.  No one can confirm it.  The former assistant manager of the Ideal Theater, Gadol, also died in Fort Santiago recently, and the brilliant Spaniard Pio Brun succumbed to T.B.</p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
