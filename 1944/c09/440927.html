As a matter of fact, ours is so narrow that we have only one choice left to us....  With the unanimous approval of my Cabinet and the Council of State, I have declared that a state of war exists between the Republic of the Philippines and the United States and Great Britain.  This declaration of a state of war is an official confirmation or recognition of an existing condition.</blockquote>				<blockquote>Fortunately for us, the Emperor of Japan, in a Pact of Alliance entered into with us, has pledged itself to safeguard our territorial integrity and independence.</blockquote>				<blockquote>About a week ago I announced that the Republic has but one course to pursue, and that is, to render every aid and assistance to the Imperial Government of Japan <em>short of conscription</em> of Filipino manhood for active military service....  I stand and will stand by that statement.</blockquote>				<p>KGEX had previously broadcasted that there would be conscription; Laurel set the record straight last night.  His voice was uninspired, lifeless, and a little hoarse, as if he had a cold.  Each word came out labored and heavy, and his voice broke a little on two occasions.  One was when he said, "short of conscription."  It didn't come out clear, so Laurel repeated the whole sentence, literally bellowing the words out.  It sounded like he was at the end of his rope; that the load he carried was too much for him.  Perhaps he meant that HE had "no choice left."</p>								<p>The Japanese are taking several blocks near us, and on nearby streets the Navy ordered everyone to evacuate within three days — an impossible feat these days.  You've never seen such hate until you've seen a family forced out from their house.</p>								<p>Everyday that we live in peace is a day of miracles for us here in Manga Avenue.  Today two MPs came to check our house again, supposedly for "safety" reasons.  The Japanese definitely want all the houses in Hillcrest.  Keller is in turmoil; he doesn't want to move.  With a baby due in December, the strain on his wife is so severe that she's abed.  Hillcrest is on Manila's outskirts.  Food costs less there as many are willing to sell at a big discount rather than run the gauntlet of sentries, inspectors and transportation problems in going the extra two or three miles.</p>								<p>Imamura, the Japanese liaison man, resigned his post.  There were just too many complaints of house stealing, and too little that he could do.  Despite his best efforts, the army and navy have been running hog-wild, leaving him to bear the brunt of public indignation.  He's been here for many years before the war and is married to a Filipina.  Inamura would love to quit but can't.  Others like him, particularly those at Santo Tomas who object to the general treatment being heaped upon the internees, are in the same boat.</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
