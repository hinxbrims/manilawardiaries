"Philippines is Reassuring Ally, says Premier Koiso" in a blatant lie to his own people.  "Americans bomb Davao Hospital" — apparently they have yet to hit a military target.</p>								<p>"His Majesty Opens Nippon Diet Session."  Tojo was replaced because he was losing the war, but Koiso has no new ideas: <i>Enhance motivation; increase food production; mobilize labor for production of munitions....</i>  Sounds like they're in trouble already.  No mention about offensives; nothing to substantiate hope for a victory.  Navy Minister Yonai says, "Air superiority is essential."  His submarines are doing fine, and there is "stiff resistance" in Guam, Tinian and New Guinea.  Even more incredible, Sugiyama says they're still holding out in New Britain, Bougainville, Rabaul, Imphal and Kohima!  (At least he skipped Guadalcanal.)</p>								<p>The Editorial asks why the Americans are coming if not for "the sole purpose of enslaving the East Asians again.  Are we not all FREE?"</p>								<p>Maurice just barged in explosively.  Yesterday he assured me his house was safe.  This morning one Watanabe presented himself, and amidst continuous giggles and coos of admiration for the paneling, linoleum flooring and the concealed shelves and cupboards, asked to rent the house.  He was a perfect gentleman though, offering in exchange the second floor of a house on P. Gomez — a Japanese red light district.  Maurice argued but the Japanese confidently announced he would return in seven to ten days with the final word on the matter.  In the meantime, he cautioned, "<i>Do not let any Japanese officer or civilian grab your house</i>"!</p>								<p>So the Japanese have gotten down to squabbling against each other to move into safe residential areas.  Watanabe even had the gall to tell Maurice and Chichita that their house was not in a safe area.  "<i>If the Americans would only drop one bomb in Santol, one in New Manila and another in Mandaluyong,</i>" sighed Maurice, "<i>the Japanese would kill each other in a mad rush to move back downtown</i>."</p>								<p>Meanwhile, munitions are now being stored in the <a href="../../_maps/intramuros.html">Manila Cathedral</a>, and I'm told that just about every church in the Cagayan Valley now houses military stores.</p>								<p>Today the Japanese backed down a bit and allowed a few families here to stay until September 30.  However, they dropped into the house opposite ours and ordered the Siy family out — and that's after they had already taken four homes from the family.</p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
