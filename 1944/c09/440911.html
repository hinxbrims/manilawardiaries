				<p class="first">Something has to happen soon.  Rice is now P2,600 a sack if you can find it.  Public health is falling rapidly, evidence of which is all over the streets.  One poor fellow who won't last a week sits in <a href="../../mapper/escolta.html">Carriedo Street</a> with his right leg twice its normal size — one whole mass of infection starting to turn blue.  Some of the beggars are really destitute; others are opportunists.  I saw one going to her choice corner by tricycle — today's costly and luxurious mode of travel.</p>
				
				<p>A Filipino who lost his wife and two kids over a year ago told me he was looking forward to the coming invasion.  His brother, who teaches golf to Japanese officers, was told to go home last Saturday because "<i>American planes were around</i>."  Dad, who's been here since 1896, says that the weather now is ideal for an invasion of Southern Luzon, before the rains arrive; otherwise it's best to wait for January.</p>
				
				<p>Just after 1000 this morning, the siren blew twice, signaling an <i>All Clear</i>.  A comedy ensued in the Escolta as one policeman tried to chase everyone off the streets while another yelled for them to return.  The <i>All Clear</i> brought only disappointment — how long do we have to wait?</p>
				
				<p>We're impatient, even if we really expect raids to begin late September or early October.  The Japanese, expecting it since March, have been nervous ever since.  We're hanging on every word, as in Roosevelt's congratulatory message on Osmeña's 66th birthday: "<i>I trust that before many MONTHS have passed....</i>"  My God, Franklin, we're thinking of DAYS or WEEKS — not MONTHS!  Osmeña said: "<i>Our day of liberation is INEVITABLE....</i>"  Why didn't he say "IMMINENT"?</p>
				
				<p>La Vanguardia reported raids on Davao and Cagayan: 400 bombers and fighters on Saturday; 180 planes on Sunday.  "Damage sustained was insignificant," but "a minute check-up on losses is being undertaken."  Of course, they downed six and "gravely" damaged a "great number."</p>
				
				<p>Well, Monday has passed and we've received no word on the fate of Manga Avenue, perhaps because of the rain.</p>
