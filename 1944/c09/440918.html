Schaer lives several kilometers from the Zablan airfield, in a beautiful house and lot with many papaya, banana and mango trees, a fine vegetable garden with cassava, camotes, carrots, corn and onions.</p>								<p>The Jesuits are being kicked around too.  The Japanese exiled them to the provinces after taking most of their buildings in Manila.  The Fathers packed-up and departed for their four abandoned houses in Polo, Bulacan, spending P22,000 on transportation alone.  After installing new wiring and 11 toilets, the Japanese want to boot them out again.</p>								<p>Zuellig finally decided to move out — they live pretty close to Nichols airfield anyway.  They weren't happy, but decided not to ask for rent.  The Japanese got sore.  <i>OK, then a sack of rice a month</i>.  The Japanese got sorer.  <i>OK, a thousand Pesos a month then</i> — very cheap considering rents these days.  The Japanese got real mad.  They settled on P450 a month.  The Japanese and English contract read: "I ... Zuellig, do hereby offer...."  Perturbed at the idea, Dr. Zuellig protested: "<i>But I'm not offering, I'm being kicked out!</i>"  After some finagling, the wording was changed to "cede."  Incidentally, while his tenant is away on an "inspection tour," he isn't getting any rent.</p>								<p>Then there's Sixto L. Sison and his Dakota Apartments.  The Japanese Army placed a seal on it one day, but one of his 15 tenants — a Japanese naval officer — promptly put three seals on the building, one on top of the Army seal.  The Navy agreed to pay him P90,000 for the furniture — the building cost him P75,000 a year ago.  The exchange rate is 26:1 today.</p>								<p>It's no surprise that the reputation of the Japanese is at rock bottom.  The fools even thought they could slip supplies from the Nichols-Nielson airfields into the Pasay Church at night without anyone noticing.</p>								<p>La Vanguardia says an American submarine torpedoed and sank a ship carrying about 1,750 American POWs.  Any comment would be useless now.</p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
