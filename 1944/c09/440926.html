The actual count is 300 on Thursday and 67 on Friday.  It's common knowledge that the PGH treated not one case of injury due to bombs — all were shrapnel-related.  Director of Health, Eusebio Aguilar, observed that "the majority of these cases were the result of thoughtless curiosity and carelessness....  Very few were hit while taking cover."  An example of just how casually Filipinos took to the raids is that in the hospital itself, a piece of shrapnel went through the roof and landed square in the middle of a table of nurses calmly having their repast.</p>								<div class="image left" style="width: 139; margin-top: 15px; margin-left: 24px; margin-right: 8px">					<img src="posters.jpg" border="0" width="139" height="300" alt="Posters">					<div class="caption" style="margin-top: 5px">					"Nation Aroused"					</div>				</div>								<p><b>Posters</b> are being plastered all over Manila: <i>Murderers of the Sky Seek More Victims</i>; <i>American Policy: Destroy Everything You Can See</i>; <i>America Challenged, The Philippines Accepted</i> — the last one showing a youth shaking his fist while a woman kneels over a dying girl.  The Japanese are well aware that Filipinos did not react to the bombing as they had expected us to.</p>								<p>"Nine Planes Downed in Visayas....  350 planes in several waves raided Legaspi, Tacloban, Cebu and Bacolod" on Sunday, continuing the "indiscriminate bombing of Philippine territory."  What hurts the Japanese most is that it was not indiscriminate at all but too accurate.  They admitted "some losses in shipping," otherwise claimed "negligible" damage.</p>								<p>People are talking about the Manila Cathedral being jammed with munitions.  Today, the Japanese closed the Santa Cruz and Tondo Churches.  They are ousting all tenants around the former; the belief is that it will become a munitions dump.  Even private homes are being used to store munitions!</p>								<p>Sentries now patrol Manga Avenue since a big shot Japanese moved in opposite the Campos' house.  The rumor is that it's Lt. Gen.
