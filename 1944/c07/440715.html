Chunking Line [the Chennault line of airbases] pushed back 1,000 kilometers.</p>								<p>I just heard this morning of a 12-page letter recently sent by Recto to Kuroda.  In it, Recto "frankly" answered Kuroda's complaints of lack of Filipino unity and support.  Among the reasons cited by Recto: The only thing independent in the Philippines is the flag; Japanese actions of ousting Filipinos from their homes and taking the furniture when they move out; Japanese actions in the provinces and in Fort Santiago.  Recto also complained that though he is foreign minister of the Republic, he has become a foreigner to his own people.  He had other things to say, which he nicely sugared.  Being a poet and a lawyer, he's no fool when it comes to writing briefs.</p>								<p>Going down <a href="../../mapper/escolta.html">Rizal Avenue</a> I saw at least 2,000 newly arrived Japanese soldiers marching in full kit and perspiring freely.  An hour later as I was cycling back from the Escolta I saw more troops marching in.  The city has plenty of navy sailors and officers — no doubt a large and important convoy has arrived.  Around Plaza Goiti, people, including old-time Japanese soldiers, stood gaping at the new arrivals.  The old-timers seemed bigger and healthier than the new troops.</p>								<p>Business is in the dumps.  Talk of a possible evacuation weakened prices in the black market.  The Swiss Benevolent Society of the Philippines issued a circular advising members to have their blood typed, and to be ready for an emergency evacuation — preferably with a pushcart!</p>								<p>Schaer's lunch re his July 12 ordeal went off okay.  The Japanese ate everything and left no thanks.  Mark up one defeat for Schaer.</p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
