Shot in the mouth, he screamed and ran a few steps before the killer shot him again in the temple.  No policemen were around.  I understand he had two pistols on his body.</p>								<p>Several days ago in Sampaloc, Mercedes Lopez (from a well-known family) was shot four times in her chest.  She was rushed to <a href="../../_maps/stotomas.html">Mary Chiles' Hospital</a> where it's believed she died.  Many say she was a well-known spy.  Rumors say liquidation squads have a list of 350 names.  Two or three days ago, the headless corpse of a Japanese was left on the railroad tracks near here.  His head still hasn't been found.</p>								<p>Commentator, in fine form, says the Germans do not mind evacuating to some easily defended 'zero' line running through Riga, Kaunas, Brest-Litovsk, and Luov.  While he was busy penning those lines yesterday, the Russians were busy taking Luov [Lemberg].</p>								<p>La Vanguardia: "General plan of evacuation being studied."  Malacañan formed a committee — the aim is to reduce government personnel here to the minimum.</p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
