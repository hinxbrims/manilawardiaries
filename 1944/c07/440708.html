Chiang Kai-shek explained that Japan wanted to secure the Canton-Hankow-Peiping railroad to aid in the evacuation of troops from Burma, Indochina, Malaya and Canton.</p>								<p>Anticipating Allied attacks on Caen, the Germans moved their headquarters from Paris to Nancy, taking along with them the government of Occupied France.</p>								<p>In Saipan, 9,000 Japanese soldiers have been buried and 7,000 civilians are in American hands.  The rest are pressed into a little corner in the northeast.</p>								<p>Tribune: "Air-raid Siren practice set in the City Monday."</p>								<p>Alunan is at the PGH — feigning sickness.  He's just tired of being feted, watched, and breathed-on by the indefatigable Japanese; but he's not fooling them.  One said to him recently: "<i>95% of the Filipinos are pro-American, the other 5% are double-crossers</i>" — insinuating he's one of the latter.</p>								<p>After Aquino's "gratitude mission" to Japan, where he was decorated, wined and feted amidst pompous splendor and publicity, Laurel banished him into political limbo again by making him chief of the Kalibapi.  Actually, all members of the Philippine government are trying to stay out of the limelight.  Outside of Aquino and Laurel, no government member has ever been pro-Japanese.  As for Laurel, I admit that he's in a difficult situation.  Time will tell.</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
