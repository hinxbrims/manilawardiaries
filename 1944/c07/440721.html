One report said the Japanese closed one theater for two days after the crowd booed loudly.</p>								<p>Two startling bits of news: The Tojo cabinet resignation and the attempt on Hitler's life.  I wonder how Commentator will explain.</p>								<p>Tribune: "Super-Cabinet being formed in Japan."  Prime Minister Tojo resigned; General Kuniaki Koiso and Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai form a new Cabinet with General Yoshijiro Umezu as Chief of Staff.  The change speaks volumes — the Tojo Cabinet was supposed to have been at its maximum strength; the Japanese people at their optimum point in spirit and determination.  Saipan was the fuse for the latest explosion in Japanese internal affairs.</p>								<p>"Attempt on Hitler's Life Fails."  Swiss Radio said that three Generals died, including Keitel.  Tokyo's German news denied any deaths: "Hitler was only slightly burned."</p>								<p>"Rice Growers must think of country, not of selves" — warns Laurel at the Rice Grower's Convention.</p>								<p>Domei: "Exploits of Japanese Special Units told."  Captain Inoue's 15 men sneaked into a British airfield in Palel and destroyed 13 enemy aircraft in the night of July 3.  Sub-Lieutenant Yamada's 8 men sneaked into the rear areas and attacked the barracks, arms depot and fuel dumps on the night of July 6.  All returned.</p>								<p>The Editorial is about "The GREAT Philippine Fortress":</p>								<blockquote>We have reached a stage where further counter-offensives of the enemy must be stopped dead in their tracks....  The Philippine Fortress stands resolutely as one of the invulnerable bases from which the last and consummative operation shall be launched as Nippon again takes the offensive.</blockquote>								<p>At least the Japanese know better than to ask the Filipinos to fight.</p>								<p>FLASH: Americans landed in Guam.</p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
