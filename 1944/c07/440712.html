The Japanese magnanimously turn over to the Philippines 15 government-owned corporations — all big money-losers.  In addition, The City of Manila Tramco Enterprise and the Manila Gas Corporation have been "consigned" to the government for "administration and operation" — the latter is losing P150,000 per month before depreciation.  Administrative offices turned over include the Sugar Association [there's no sugar anyway]; the Salt Control Association; the Leaf Tobacco Company [no transportation anyway]; the Shipping Association [after they've chartered all remaining ships], and Primco after they've taken 40% of its stocks of about P11 million book value.  (The 40% is worth P150 million in today's prices!)</p>								<p>In return, the Philippine Republic, very happy with this Japanese display of generosity, has "invited" the Imperial Army to administer the following: Manila Railroad, Liquid Fuel Distribution, Copra Control, the SS Fathometer (our geodetic ship), Telephones, Power Corporation and so on.  De las Alas thanks the Japanese for passing all the white elephants to us: "Truly, we cannot adequately express in words our deepest appreciation for such an act of true magnanimity."  (<em>We can, but we'd rather stay alive.</em>)</p>								<p class="center">. . . .</p>								<p>At 2200 yesterday, a gang of armed youths attempted to rob the De la Riva house nearby and met with a determined woman, Mila, who challenged them.  She pushed one too far so he put two bullets above her left knee.  At 0200, two robbers attempted but failed to enter the Sotelo house.  The point is, despite the strict curfew and at the risk of being shot on sight, robberies are rampant.  The reason is obvious: people cannot afford to buy food.  Nine out of ten personnel in government offices arrive at work, register, then leave to try to make a living.  Some say the police don't want to tangle with robbers because they're only given one bullet!</p>								<p class="center">. . . .</p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div>		<div class="footer2">		<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="710" align="left">			<tr align="center">				<td align="center" valign="top" width="55">					&nbsp;				</td>				<td align="center" valign="top" width="200">					&nbsp;				</td>				<td align="center" valign="top" width="246">				<br><span class="inLink"><a href="#p1">- Top -</a></span>				</td>								<td align="center" valign="top" width="209">					&nbsp;				</td>			</tr>		</table>	</div><!-- ***************** PAGE 2 ***************** --><a name="p2"></a>	<div class="header2">		&nbsp;	</div>	<div class="main2">		<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="710" align="center">			<tr align="center">				<td align="center" valign="top" width="55">					&nbsp;				</td>			<td align="left" valign="top" width="655">							<div class="inLink">| <a href="#p1">Pg.1 The Give-Back</a>| Pg.2 |</div>				<span class="date r">Schaer's Ordeal</span>				<span class="date">July 12, 1944</span>				<p class="first">Schaer's soda fountain motor caught fire last night.  Some Japanese from a Navy purchasing agency next door broke in and saved his restaurant.  Schaer was profuse in his thanks but embarrassed.  What to offer — a bottle of wine?  Sure enough, the Japanese were insulted and stormed out.  But this was only the beginning.  An hour later one returned for the bottle!!  But even that wasn't the end of it.</p>								<p>In the afternoon, Schaer was called into the Japanese Purchasing Office, running into several very angry-looking and definitely enraged Japs.  They had been insulted by Schaer!  They had done him a big favor and he hadn't even thanked the manager....</p>								<p class="dialogA">"Oh, but I did ... several times.  I even offered..."</p>						<p class="dialogB">"No you didn't!"</p>						<p>Schaer was going to protest again, but noticed three Japs coming toward him slowly — one taking his wristwatch off.  He steeled himself for the coming beating.  What could he do?</p>						<p class="dialogA">"Are you the manager?  If so, I admit I didn't thank you.  I'm sorry.  Actually I didn't know who was.  I made my thanks general...."</p>						<p class="dialogB">"You... you... you rotten white face!  I hate white faces!" said the manager in a cold rage.  (<em>Mind you, Schaer said he was an educated person.</em>)</p>						<p class="dialogA">"I'm Swiss," said Schaer, hoping it would make a difference.</p>						<p class="dialogB">"We saved your store...and what have you done for us?  Nothing... you haven't even said thanks.  It's an insult!" He shrieked.</p>						<p>Schaer waited for the inevitable blows to start.  There was nothing to do but take it.</p>						<p class="dialogA">"Well, I offered a bottle of wine..." he began meekly.</p>						<p class="dialogB">"Bah!  That's not enough!"</p>						<p class="dialogA">"What can I do... what can I offer?  Money?  I was afraid to offer it."</p>						<p class="dialogB">"If we want that, we'll ask for it."</p>						<p>Schaer swallowed but stood his ground. It was necessary to get along with these fellows.  His store lay unprotected each night.</p>						<p class="dialogA">"Well, tell me what you want," he persisted.</p>						<p class="dialogB">"The very least you could do is invite us all to dinner," said the one who hated white faces.</p>						<p class="dialogA">"Very well," said Schaer, relieved.  "Shall we make it tomorrow for lunch at the Cherry Kitchen?"</p>						<p class="dialogB">"No, we can't leave at noon...make it tonight."</p>						<p class="dialogA">"Sorry," said Schaer, "but the evening is impossible.  I live too far and there is no transportation after 7:00."  The Jap considered it...</p>						<p class="dialogB">"Well, we'll eat tomorrow at your place."</p>						<p class="dialogA">"I don't serve lunch but I'll order it specially made..."</p>						<p class="dialogA">"Sorry but we really can't leave this place at noon."</p>						<p class="dialogA">"All right," said Schaer, "I'll have it cooked anyway and send it to your place."</p>						<p class="dialogB">"All right," said the Jap, partially mollified but not ready to show friendliness.  Suddenly he jerked his head.  "You... a Swiss?"</p>						<p>Schaer nodded and made a little speech, thanking them all once again.  Should he serve wine?  <i>No.</i>  A little conversation followed as the tension eased.  But one fellow refused to change and was still angry...</p>						<p class="dialogB">"I will not eat your food," he announced.</p>						<p class="dialogA">"My gosh, I've made up.  What more can I do?"</p>						<p class="dialogB">"Imagine offering ONLY a bottle of wine!"</p>						<p class="dialogA">"Look, the lunch tomorrow will be good.  I want you to be a sport and accept it."</p>						<p class="dialogB">"Naaw!"</p>						<p class="dialogA">"Aww, come on," said Schaer, waxingly.</p>						<p class="dialogB">"Naaw, I won't."</p>								<p>But a moment later he changed his mind.  By the end they even became quite friendly and shook hands.  Schaer's face was still red from the strain when he told me the story.  "<i>Damn it!</i>" he said.  "<i>If this store had only burned, I would've had to retire.  I wish it had — I'm fed up with it</i>."</p>								<p>What his wife said was much stronger.</p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>	</div>	<!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer2">		<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="710" align="left">			<tr align="center">				<td align="center" valign="top" width="55">					&nbsp;				</td>				<td align="center" valign="top" width="200">					&nbsp;				</td>				<td align="center" valign="top" width="246">				<br><span class="inLink"><a href="#p1">- Top -</a></span>				</td>								<td align="center" valign="top" width="209">					&nbsp;				</td>			</tr>		</table>	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
