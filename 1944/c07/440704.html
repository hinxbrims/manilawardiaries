A large poster slapped on a streetcar so incensed the Japanese that they suspended the service on that line for a while.  Best of all was a four-page newspaper — "Philippines' Herald" — with the crossed flags, date and excerpts of the Philippine Constitution inside.  Many stayed home expecting something to happen.  Nothing did.</p>								<div class="image right" style="width: 250; margin-top: 15px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 6px">					<img src="canton_rail.jpg" border="0" width="250" height="182" alt="V1">					<div class="caption" style="margin-top: 11px">					Kwangtung-Hunan Railway					</div>				</div>				<p>Tribune: "Japs driving northward along Canton rail line....

He was apparently "scared out of his wits by our fierce attacks."  <em>Or he simply messed up a forced landing.</em></p>								<p>At 2020 two short whistles brought everyone on our side of the street out — a practice call.  We chatted, joked and jeered at the latecomers until someone said: "<i>Gosh! We'd better stop this — it's too much like a July 4 celebration</i>."</p>								<p>Other news: Rice has touched a new high — P900 a sack; sugar is P1,400 a sack.
