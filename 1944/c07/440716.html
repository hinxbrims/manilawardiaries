Two minutes later we heard another big one accompanied by two or three smaller explosions.  A minute later — three minutes from the first explosion — Japanese fighters took to the air, proving they were on the alert.  A big fire at the Port Area, probably oil-based, blackened the sky by 0810.  This is the second fire of this type in thirty days — the first was around Pier 1.</p>								<p>Tribune: "SEVERE PUNISMENT FOR SABOTAGE" — Laurel's Proclamation No. 20.  "Japanese forces back policy of Republic against Looters" — more likely, instigated it.  Editorial: "Heaviest penalty to looters."  In short, a full campaign.</p>								<p>"Japanese Navy is Biding Her Time for last Crushing Blow on Foe."  It's Commentator trying to explain why the Japanese fleet did not engage in Saipan, something he ardently wished for and predicted they would do a number of times.  "The conditions required by the Japanese Navy to initiate a free-for-all fight are not yet fulfilled ... maybe."  He hopes that "the mist of mystery surrounding the Marianas has practically been cleared up....  <i>It wouldn't be worthwhile to risk a decisive combat of fleet versus fleet if the Japanese Armada fails to trap the entire body</i>"!</p>								<p>More troops continue to stream into Manila — some estimate 150,000 Japanese soldiers arrived.  The city's jam-packed.  The Burgos School was occupied again this morning.  The troops there have been exercising with terrific lung-tearing grunts.</p>								<p>One version of the Japanese asking Filipinos to declare war on the U.S. has Manuel Roxas replying NAW, or words to that effect.  When one Japanese insisted, Roxas replied: "<i>You are at war with Americans.  We Filipinos are not in it.  That's all there is to it</i>."  A colonel advanced as if to hit Don Manuel, but Laurel stepped in and glared him into submission.</p>								<p>One Japanese living across a little park by Maurice and Chichita has been bothering them with little requests lately: a duck, a rooster, and even mangoes from their fruitless tree.  One officer told Maurice: "<i>You know, pretty soon, maybe, Americans come.  Then we go bang, bang, bang, bang and Americans then run....  We Japanese very strong</i>," he said, inflating his chest.  "<i>All work ... no drink.  Americans, big men ... all drink only</i>."  His younger accomplice is friendlier.  Once he squared his shoulders and made a formal presentation: "<i>I give this 'Lux' to you.  Good soap.  Price downtown P23.00.  Thank you</i>."</p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
