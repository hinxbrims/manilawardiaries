Undercover organization broken-up following capture of wireless corps headquarters.  Over 120 persons involved."  All were arrested; a Lieutenant Commander "Q" was killed in a raid on the wireless headquarters in Mindoro.  The Japanese found out when they got a copy of documents distributed by a Lieutenant Colonel C.I.O. — Chief Intelligence Officer of a guerilla unit attached to the USAFFE.  The military members were not named though the following were in yesterday's La Vanguardia:</p>								<ul>				<li>Mary [Boyd] Stagg: Cosmopolitan Church (Methodist); contributed money and arms.</li>								<li>Branch Zalica [Blanche Jurika]: Church of Immaculate Conception; one of the leaders.  Distributed anti-Japanese propaganda.</li>								<li>Rodolfo Rocha: Secretary of the Archbishop; ditto.</li>								<li>Diego Paz: Cashier of the Bank of Philippine Islands; ditto.</li>								<li>Luisa Gonzaga: a Catholic sister.</li>								<li>Helen Grace Moore: Philippine Methodist Church and ex-teacher in Nagasaki.  Distributed pamphlets from "Alen Wilk" [Helen Wilkes?] of the same church.</li>								<li>Mary Pom: American missionary.  Distributed Japanese writings of one Angel Guerrero, a "Secretary of the Mayor of Manila."</li>								<li>Fathers Hurley, Bernard F. Doucette, Leo M. Kinn and other Ateneo Jesuits; hiding arms.</li>				</ul>				<p>Blanche Jurika contacted a manager of De la Rama (Pirovano, no doubt), and a Lt. Col. "L" (aged 41 — Lim?) was responsible for the papers.</p>								<p>The town is also abuzz re Goebbel's speech.  The German Club version has him saying Germany is invincible; the Swiss version has him saying Germany can no longer win the war; the Russians are about to "touch civilization" — German territory.  And if that happens, something BIG is going to shake the world.</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
