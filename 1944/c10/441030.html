Most people stayed home; I biked to town for a coffee at Schaer's.  An atmosphere of extreme caution permeated throughout the city.  It's always like that after a Japanese licking; that's when they raise their loudest propaganda while scouting around for rumormongers who would set the people straight.  A Spanish citizen named Rodriguez who lives just in Altura was taken to Fort Santiago for using an unregistered radio.  He didn't deny it.  Another family got rid of their short-wave gadget as a precaution.</p>								<p>In this tense atmosphere, people avoided gathering in large groups, and clung strictly to business, which made it hard to get the results of yesterday's raids.  The best I could get was one warship sunk in the Bay and two fires were still burning far at sea.  I heard that U.S. subs sank 3 cruisers and damaged a fourth off Palawan, before the Leyte battles.</p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
