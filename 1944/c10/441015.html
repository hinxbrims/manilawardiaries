An hour later Daihon-ei said 160 planes were <i>confirmed</i> shot down, but admitted to "<i>some damage in aircraft and shipping as well as on land</i>."</p>								<p>"Impressive simplicity marks Independence Day Ceremonies" — held at Malacañan at 1800.  The Editorial called it "a peaceful observance" — <em>indeed, most stayed home</em>.  It added that the blows suffered by the Americans in their raids on Taiwan forced them to abandon their intention of swinging south toward the Philippines.  No mention was made of any Luzon raid, speaking of which, it's <b>0958</b> and the <i>Air Raid</i> siren is on again.</p>								<p>"Ambassador Murata gives P500,000 Personal Gift" — which makes the Japanese Empire look like pikers for donating only two million pesos.  I see also that three weeks after the proclamation of war, Recto and Laurel are still defending it.</p>								<p>Time out ... I hear planes, antiaircraft booms, and machine-gunning over newly formed clouds.  Surprisingly, eight Japanese fighters got together and scurried south.  No doubt they'll be back to try and catch the Americans on their return trip, though their planes aren't fast enough.</p>								<p><b>1025</b>: I hear about thirty pistol and rifle shots — no doubt potshots aimed at a parachute descending towards Pandacan.  A plane diving on Nichols streams smoke from its firing guns.  The Japanese tanks below us have started to move out.  A roar overhead now — close enough for me to ID the dive-bomber: an SB2C-1.</p>								<p>Ducked as a round exploded next door with a blinding flash.  There's smoke in Bachrach's garden, whiffs of it in my nostrils as I write this.  That was the climax.  No ... they're still diving ... overhead now, low and LOUD ... hitting the Bay area too.  I've just made up my mind: <em>There's going to be a landing within seven days!</em>  All this — the Ryukyus, Formosa, Luzon, and now Manila again — is too ambitious for attrition's sake.</p>								<p><b>1048</b>: No antiaircraft, just the drone of planes far away.  It seems to me that American fighters preceded the bombers by a few minutes.  Whoa!  Planes overhead and low ... Japanese.  Unlike the roar of American engines, you can actually distinguish the sound of individual pistons in Japanese engines.  All quiet by <b>1110</b> save for Japanese fighters overhead.</p>								<p>As usual, Dad took the raid in the garden, next door to the Burgos School, where the Japanese still have machine guns mounted.  The <i>Alert</i> went on at <b>1330</b>, and we're still without gas or electricity at <b>1535</b>.  It was a small raid and certainly not a surprise.  We're still on alert at <b>2100</b>.  The Japanese claim to have shot down 18 out of 60 raiders that targeted their airfields.</p>								<p></p>								<p></p>								<p></p>								<p></p>								<blockquote></blockquote>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
