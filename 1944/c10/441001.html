Ours stated in <em>katakana</em> that 125 Manga Avenue was reserved for a Commander Ito Division.  I protested: "<em>You guaranteed we wouldn't be ousted!</em>"</p>								<p>"<i>Yes we did</i>," said the officer, pointing to the seal, "<i>this notice is to prevent our army, navy or embassy from taking your family out.</i>"</p>								<p>After we all got our seals, he asked which houses would the five families move into.  Ding pointed them out, which seemed to surprise the Japanese.  "<i>What about the other houses?</i>"</p>								<p>Ding said they were either too small or too crowded.  The officer wanted to remove their seals but Ding talked him out of it by insisting that our agreement was for the protection of ALL houses.  "<i>Awright, awright ... we protect</i>."</p>								<p>Mike Campos protested when some MPs wanted to move in last night, but he settled on giving them the sala and porch.  Unfortunately he offended an officer by indicating he could sleep in the front porch.  He got away with it too, but he's giving up his main bedroom today.</p>								<p>The Camposes and Mrs. Guttridge hurriedly moved things into our basement today.  It seems an officer took over his fine bureau before he could move it out, hence the rush.  Four Japanese will sleep in his room.  They placed their belongings there and announced: "<i>If something missing now we get mad.  Especially our pistols — if that missing we shoot all the servants</i>."  Mike quickly gave them a special lock and washed his hands off it.</p>								<p>Seeing the Camposes move out in such hurry softened the Japanese up temporarily.  Apologizing profusely, they acted kind and gentle until they saw the family's three automobiles.  Turning harsh, they gave the family four hours to push them out — a lot of work considering the three cars had to share one set of rims and tires.  We received only the Chevrolet today; the Garriz boys will help with the rest tomorrow.  Mike will use 125 Manga Avenue as his address even if he doesn't live here.  I've promised him a bed any night without notice.</p>								<p>Paul Meyer was given two weeks to move, so he called to ask me if we could house his car.  I had to tell him that I needed to check if we had the space.  And that's the story today — pushcarts entering our house all day under the watchful eyes of the Kempeitai.  At least they know we are upholding our part of the bargain.  In Manga Avenue we've all agreed: it's one for all and all for one.  If anyone gets kicked out, we'll protest together.</p>								<p>Today, the Japanese flew additional planes into Manila but otherwise kept air activity to the minimum.  So far they've lost 6,391 planes and 1,237 ships in 1944.  Only ten ships including a large tanker are in the Bay now.  Someone swore that the recent Pandacan oil fire was not started by American planes but by antiaircraft shrapnel.  He was there at the time and guaranteed that no plane dove on Pandacan.  Some 1,000 drums of aviation fuel went up in smoke during the 1-1/2 hour fire.  Well, it was big while it lasted.</p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
