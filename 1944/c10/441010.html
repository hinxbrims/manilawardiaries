A Capt. Keizo Matsushima, Chief of the Press Section of the Japanese Fleet in China, says that Japanese air strength in the Pacific will "far surpass that of the enemy's first line planes."  He talks about non-existent planes while remaining mum about his "silent navy."</p>								<p>"Withdrawals allowed from enemy banks."  Beats me why anyone would want to.</p>								<p>Practically all of <a href="../../_maps/sanjuan.html">New Manila</a> (the newest residential district) is in Japanese hands now.  Broadway, which bisects the district and joins España to San Juan, has drums of fuel under each and every mango tree.  Japanese Army officers, spooked by a few bombs on Fort McKinley, are making a dash for houses in the San Juan-Mandaluyong district.  They just want about 15 houses, but not near Prospect Grove, they say frankly, as that's too close to the old Pinaglabanan munitions dump!  Too dangerous for the military, but good enough for civilians, eh?  On the other hand, it could be a ploy because they're spreading munitions and fuel from there all over San Juan.  Many unkind words are being said about the Japanese hiding behind residential skirts, but I'm reserving the unkindest comment for last.</p>								<p>A motorcade sped through town today, led by a motorcycle and followed by five cars, a car of MPs and a truckload of soldiers with machine guns.  Traffic was blocked, bystanders were forced to face away from the street, and windows overlooking the route were ordered shut.  Startled Manilans, never short of an explanation, decided the "fat man" riding on the fifth car was General Tomoyuki Yamashita of Singapore fame.  He must've arrived in that large (by Japanese standards) bomber escorted by three fighters that flew in several days ago.  The Japanese kept ten fighters in the air while he was out and about today.  He's here to replace Kuroda, who's been canned for the September 21 and 22 debacles.</p>								<p>Now the unkindest cut of all: Just where do you think Kuroda was during the bombings?  Directing operations from the safest possible place — Santo Tomas!</p>								<p>The Japanese navy procurement office next door to the Astoria is buying bicycles again, and this time they are not being particular about condition, origin or ownership.  So the word is out: hang on to your bike at all times.  Incidentally, the Japanese have some new bikes too — with wooden seats.</p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
