				<p class="first">Tribune Editorial: "Asia's Defense is Impregnable."  The Japanese are feeling chipper as a result of OWI disclosures.  The article is built around Kweilin, China, and the "bogging down of the American attempts to take Peleliu."</p>
				
				<p>"Government Ready to Move to Rizal Town" (nearby) "in due time and without notice."  The Board of Information "enjoins all residents of Manila to start evacuating the city in accordance with indications already made by the Government."  So the cowardly government will run first, without doing anything at all to help the people evacuate.</p>
				
				<p>We spent a good deal of time discussing this government's exit and what to do about the emergency that confronts us.  Placido is taking his family to Baguio; Pacifico is thinking of taking his to Marinduque Island; and Santamaria is going to Nasugbu.  People are poring over maps trying to figure out where to go, even if the majority can't afford the trip, have nowhere to go, and intend to stick it out in Manila for as long as they can.  Most of the foreigners will stay, depending on each other and providence to pull them through the coming crisis.  People are accumulating food, medicines and pushcarts for any emergency.  Meanwhile, the Japanese moved ammunition into the <a href="../../mapper/paco.html">Paco Cemetery</a> and are now building a high fence around it.  Plenty of trees there allow for good shelter and natural camouflage.</p>
				
				<p>A rumor making the rounds is that American subs landed some Filipino troops in Catanduanes Island<sup>†</sup>.  It shows the boys are up to date on what to expect, even if a bit optimistic.  I'm regarded as somewhat of a pessimist these days because I expect nothing in Manila until February at least.  There are still some incurable optimists around even after two years of false prophecies.</p>
