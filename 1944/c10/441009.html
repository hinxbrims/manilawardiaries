He wasn't happy even though he moved into a larger home in a safer district.  All the good houses from the Santa Mesa Bridge to almost San Juan have been "tagged" in the last two days.</p>								<p>I think it takes a good deal of guts to evacuate to the provinces.  It's said that bandits are operating in nearby San Mateo, while the so-called "Texas Gangs" are operating on the public highways — the modern variation of the American covered wagon saga.  Nevertheless the trek is proceeding by train, truck, carretela, and even by foot.  That's our country in October of 1944.  Some will find safety; others will find peril; all are heading towards their fate, just as the 60,000 aliens who plan to remain in Manila are.  The latter will take their chances and die here if necessary, but at least they'll "<i>go like gentlemen</i>."  Actually they're afraid to go to the provinces, a sentiment shared by even some Filipinos born and bred there.</p>								<p>Meanwhile, some 15 demands for lenders to accept payments are on the court calendar — a symptom of these abnormal times.  Lenders don't want to be repaid in worthless Japanese money.  Even if forced to, the payments shouldn't be recognized after the war.</p>								<p></p>								<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
