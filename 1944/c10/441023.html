				<p class="first">The rain stopped after a steady but moderate 12 hours.  I bet you can make the swellest mud pies in those foxholes out back.</p>
				
				<p>If MacArthur's communiqué tomorrow speaks of "light" air attacks, Manilans will snort.  Between 100 and 200 Japanese planes overflew Manila this morning on their way to Leyte, leaving us feeling a bit uneasy here.  Nielson Field is being used again.</p>
				
				<p>The two parachutists I saw come down recently were Japanese.  Rumors say the PC rounded up some Japanese civilians for taking pot shots against the one that landed near Pandacan.  The other parachutist came down behind the <a href="../../mapper/papandacan.html">Concordia College</a> in Santa Ana.  He landed without shoes or pants, a leg practically shot off and four fingers of one hand missing.  The garrison living there wrapped him in a blanket and took him away.  He's probably dead.</p>
				
				<p>I've waited until I could get three correlating versions of the story about an American who also bailed out.  His plane was low and on fire when he popped out — alone.  He landed near Nichols in Pasay; face slightly burned on one side.  Someone offered to hide him, but he rejected it, probably wisely.  Some fool asked for his jacket, but he indicated that he would need it and gave his goggles instead.  Offering candy and cigarettes freely to the gathering crowd, he said: "<i>Don't worry, I came here to die</i>."  Three Japanese soldiers ran up with fixed bayonets, and a tense moment ensued when the young man put a hand on his holster.  Fortunately, an officer arrived and disarmed him.  He was led away, hands tied in front, still smiling radiantly; no doubt happy to have cheated death.</p>
				
				<p>There are vague reports of others who bailed out, but I don't now if they are true.  Guerrillas supposedly cut the head off a Japanese pilot who landed in Laguna.  Another story says two Americans bailed out but only one landed alive.  The guerrillas took him to the mountains.</p>
				
				<p>After a couple of tussles with KGEX, it has dawned on me that we've built ourselves up for a bit of a letdown.  I'm sure we're all listening for great news on Leyte, but what can you expect in three days?  MacArthur hasn't much to report and the commentaries sound stale.  Some folks are wondering about Mac's plans — 600 or so ships are enough for additional landings elsewhere.  The consensus is that he'll land here in December; only a few dissenters say early November or February.</p>
