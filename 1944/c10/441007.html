In China, they've launched a four-pronged drive using 500,000 men — the most ambitious Japanese offensive since 1938.</p>								<p>The <i>Alert</i> sounded at 1220 in Manila today, exciting a lot of people at the Escolta.  Japanese troops hopped off their trucks and started chopping branches off trees to camouflage their trucks.  The <i>All Clear</i> came at 1500 without incident.</p>								<p>Tribune: "More evacuees leave city today" — 600 by train while others went by horse-drawn carts, cars and trucks.  The Ysmaels and Cachos leave today or tomorrow for Baguio.</p>								<p>Maharajah's column disparaged the people's reaction to the government's intention to move — official recognition that the people are sore.</p>								<p>Recto's reply to a Filipino doctor who went to complain about his house: "<i>I'll do what I can.

There could be more suffering here, including acute danger, but for a shorter time.  To go to the provinces means immediate hardships, expenses, and perhaps a later rescue.</p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
