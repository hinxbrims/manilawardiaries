Bessmer remarked to the secretary of the Embassy: "<em>What you are taking is our means of livelihood; and that, you can't replace</em>."</p>								<p>The answer came with a shrug: "<i>We're sorry, there's nothing we can do.  The Embassy needs houses.</i>"</p>								<p>The same three Embassy Officials who visited us last Saturday also visited the nearby Sotelos and Schultzes.  Old man Sotelo gave a superb performance.  Coughing as a consumptive in his darkened house, he said that there were already 14 living there!  The Japanese left quickly, but Sotelo had to do an encore today for another group.  Five Japanese entities are looking for safe houses: the Army, Navy, Military Police, Embassy and the Propaganda Division.  Schaer and Abad had to move into other houses in the Diliman area courtesy of the Air Force.  The radio (PIAM) division has been in Manga Avenue for six weeks now at the Garriz and Creighton houses.  Today was the Army's turn to look Manga Avenue over.  Luckily, Kunishi had them in tow.</p>								<p>Many consider the mad scramble for houses by these groups to be one of the most scandalous acts of the Occupation.  When homeowners fight back, or when the Japanese realize how shameful their actions are, they pull back a bit, becoming extremely gentle and polite.  At least until the next bombs fall.</p>								<p>The Tribune today led with another rice offensive from Laurel: "Excess rice ordered given up ... authorized quantity fixed at half sack for every resident."  Blaming "activities of hoarders and soulless speculators" for our hunger, he ignored the real reason again.  So, after five days of grace, we'll have house-to-house searches for rice, Japanese-occupied houses exempted, I'm sure.</p>								<p>In the meantime, the Americans have invaded the Palau group, coming closer and closer every day to the Philippines from all directions.  Manila's anxiety increases with each advance.</p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
