The churches were full by 0630.  An air-raid just before 0900 saw Japanese planes overhead en route to various targets.  We heard no news from the front.</p>				<p>Spent the morning patching the house while Maurice and Dad were out buying supplies.  The Da Silvas and a few other friends dropped in to say their good-byes.</p>				<p>Joe got a call from Fort Santiago.  He was commissioned as First Lieutenant and should report immediately.  I drove him to the Port Area where he collected his uniform and gear.  Told that a car would be sent for him, Joe replied, <i>“I’m ready to go right now.”</i>  Twenty minutes later, after saying goodbye to Mom and Dad by phone, he snapped me a salute and left for the war.</p>				<p>I noticed American and Filipino soldiers at the port — unshaven, dirty, drenched in sweat but tireless and uncomplaining — working like dogs to move a vast stockpile of U.S. Army goods out.  So much stuff was about it’s hard to believe the Japanese have been dropping bombs elsewhere.  No doubt this is a prime target.  Merchant ships that recently took refuge in the Bay have gone.</p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
