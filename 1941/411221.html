Sirens at 1025 caught Ma and Maurice at church during a short raid.  I listened to the news wondering about the heroic defense of Hongkong and the lull in Singapore and Manila.  The absence of news of a U.S. rescue made listening to KGEI irksome.  Went to the Menzi’s in the afternoon and got skunked at croquet — first game in two months.</p>								<p>Nichols raided again yesterday for the sixth time.  Our situation looks hopeless.  In addition to ruling the air, Japanese ships now ply our waters with impunity.  Long-envisaged defense plans relying on a 17 to 18-day rescue by the U.S. Navy were shortsighted.  Our subs are hopeless too as a defensive force: two transports and one destroyer is their two-week score.  Tokyo recently announced we had 20 subs near their waters.  They should be down here!</p>				<p>MacArthur got his 4-Stars; a Tribune picture shows him receiving a congratulatory embrace from Quezon.  The latter made his usual eloquent speech describing our predicament and hardships.  Osmeña kept his usual silence.</p>				<p>Sign of the times in the Tribune: One baby born at the outbreak of war emits several short blasts when it’s hungry and one long wail when it’s had enough (the air-raid and all-clear sirens).</p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
