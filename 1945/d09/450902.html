A typhoon raged all day on this prostrate and razed city.  We held a small reception at our rented basement home.  A borrowed genset provided electricity on occasions, while air blowing through cracks in the walls kept blowing out the candles.  The caterer arrived late and few of the few invited guests were able to come.  Gifts were out of the question, and so was a honeymoon.  Time to get along with my life and forget the past. </p>								<p class="center">. . . .</p>							<span class="date">September 9, 1945</span>								<p>A GI came by to tell us that he and my brother Joe had recently been liberated from a POW camp in Korea.  Joe was well and already en route to Manila by ship.  "<i>I'll meet this ship myself at the dock and bring him to you even if it's midnight, OK?</i>"</p>								<p>— "<em>Buddy, even 2 or 3, 4 or 5 AM!</em>"  We spread the happy news to the family.</p>								<p class="center">. . . .</p>							<span class="date">September 14, 1945</span>								<p>Again, late at night, Capt.
