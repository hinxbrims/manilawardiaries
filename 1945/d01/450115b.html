So the bridges are still up and the water's on again.  The dinky little bridge at Raon, closed to vehicular traffic, was being mined as we passed by.  Unconfirmed reports say the Arias and Heacock buildings have been mined too, as well as other buildings and streets.  People expect the Japanese to blow these up in the last minute.</p>								<p>Those crossing the Jones Bridge risk being "called" for forced labor.  A friend of mine marching to work with 49 other "volunteers" suddenly made a dash for freedom, and ran straight into another Japanese.  As his pursuer and captor pummeled him, the other 49 started to dash away by the twos and threes.  This so totally confused the tormented Japanese that my friend got away!</p>								<p>The Graemigers began returning to their home today, but the Camposes show no signs of doing so.  Some Kempeitai are apparently still living in Manga Avenue, but they are making themselves scarce and behaving very well.  A couple of Japanese also remain at the Garriz house.</p>								<p>The "Forgotten Man" around here is the Great Benigno Aquino, who once told Hans Menzi that when the Americans came he'd throw himself at the front line.  Actually, we've no word on the whereabouts of Laurel and his Cabinet, nor of Roxas, who's still a Japanese hostage.  Everyone knows they are all in Baguio of course.  Rice there is up to P50,000 a sack if you can get it.</p>								<p>Even as close to Manila as Marikina, we hear daily complaints of the Japanese stealing every morsel of food they can find.  Quite apart from the lack of transportation, they are the reason why practically no food is entering Manila.  Food prices here climbed by a third today â€” all this with very few Japanese in the city, the Americans in the lowlands, and the road to Baguio completely cut now.</p>								<p></p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
