The article speaks of San Fabian as if it were in Japanese hands while admitting the Americans have advanced 13 kilometers south of the town.</p>								<p>"Joint action against looting agreed upon" — by the city authorities and the Japanese military.  It's a bluff because the Japanese have more important things to worry about.</p>								<p>"Philippine Constabulary members told to report in 48 hours....  Willful absentees will be considered deserters, punished."  Guinto complains that "there are also reports reaching the governor" — that's him — "about doubtful activities" of some members of the PC.  Maharajah accused them of using their service pistols not to suppress looters but to loot for themselves.</p>								<p>La Vanguardia: "Baguio suffers two blind bombings" resulting in civilian casualties and homes set afire.</p>								<p>"Americans use Filipinos as shields" — just proves the propaganda department remains hard at work.</p>								<p>A traveler just arrived from Montalban was surprised to see Manila undestroyed, as the people of Montalban think Manila is burning while its inhabitants starve.  No doubt the Japanese have told the people in Baguio that the Americans have strafed houses in Manila, producing many civilian casualties.  A truck driver who left Bayombong just before the Americans took it said the highways are littered with burned vehicles and a few Japanese corpses.  He figures that "<i>the Americans must have killed or injured at least a thousand Japs a day</i>."</p>								<p>This afternoon a solitary plane strafed Japanese trucks at Santa Mesa Extension.  I dashed out but missed the plane.  What I saw instead were numerous Japanese cars, trucks and men ducking under trees and hanging on to their dead leaves (camouflage) for dear life.  It was a sight to see so many fugitives from justice in such a panic.</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
