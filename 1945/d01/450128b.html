A cartoon shows Duran, Ricarte and Ramoz pushing a blindfolded Filipino boy into bayoneting a pretty girl called "Filipinas" â€” an unwilling victim because a Japanese soldier is hiding behind her skirt.  A merciless and blood-curling article on page 9 says this "unholy trio" ought to be "tarred, feathered and burned at the stake ... several times."</p>								<p>Page 13 has a cartoon of a speeding U.S. car pulling a lassoed Japanese by the neck, watched by five spectators: Government Quisling; Buy-and-Sell Traitor; Makapili; Japanese Spy; Japanese Querida [sweetheart].  They're saying: "They got our 'tomodachi'!  What will happen to us now?" </p>								<p>Page 14 has a version of the three monkeys' 'see no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil' cartoon: "Aquino lapses into silence."  Wearing his Japanese decoration, Aquino is the middle monkey with his hands on his mouth.  "There was pathos in the voice of the repentant Quisling" when he called a meeting of the highest Kalibapi one afternoon to tell them: "'I believe that the Americans are really coming back to the Philippines.'"</p>								<p>Page 19: "NADISCO FIASCO":</p>								<blockquote>The Nadisco, headed by L.R. Aguinaldo, big-time Japanese dummy in prewar days, has been exerting maximum effort to justify the dishonesty and graft being committed by some of its crooked employees and certain unscrupulous MCCA managers....  We knew that Nadisco would be a flop right from the time it was organized, especially when Aguinaldo immediately appointed his storekeepers to positions of responsibility in the organization.  It all boils down to this: Nothing good can come out of a Japanese-inspired mind.</blockquote>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
