He said that some 300 barges were operating east of Fabian and "more than 600" ships off the bay!  Naturally, the Japanese shot up the works.</p>								<p>Maharajah warns that the Japanese would "take drastic measures" should the Americans enter Manila.  "We should have a knapsack ready at all times."  He tries to pin the blame on the Americans but it's the Japanese who haven't vacated or declared Manila an Open City.  Dynamiting bridges and important buildings will put civilians at risk — all just to exact a toll of 500 more American lives.</p>								<p>"Gifts Donated by the Imperial Japanese Army ... to the people of Pasay and Singalong" include "20 sacks of salt, 2,500 pieces of clothing ... 255 pieces of wooden furniture and other materials."  The 1,000,000 people of Manila are overwhelmed by such generosity.</p>								<p>The exchange rate has passed the 100:1 level but prices of some foods have declined from their extreme highs of a few days ago: Coconuts fell from P70 to P36; native eggs from P150 to P80; and <i>tinapay</i> [bread] P50 from P30.  People are running out of dough.</p>								<p>Manilans have suddenly become concerned — almost agog — over the likelihood of heavy street fighting in Manila, particularly those living in Intramuros (that's one place I would surely evacuate) and in downtown sections at Juan Luna, Rosario, plus Malate, Ermita and Pasay.  Maharajah's article sent many into a dither of nervousness.</p>								<p>A few Manilans have taken to crossing the Jones Bridge only in case of extreme necessity, and then preparing for the precarious journey by roping an arm in a sling and pouring a strong antiseptic on it, or feigning some other injury.  Most others just cross the Pasig by banca at Pandacan to avoid the bridge.  I went downtown today and found the Escolta ranks thinned to a new low.</p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
