Four B-24s downed, 3 damaged over Clark Field....  The enemy bombing was <i>ineffective</i>."  One of twenty B-24s over Cebu and one of ten over Davao were shot down.  "The raiders caused <i>no damage</i> in these two raids."  But all Manila has heard stories that the countryside is strewn with wrecked Japanese planes.</p>								<p>"Enemy Desperate" — two words that usually signal a coming American advance.</p>								<blockquote>Meanwhile, American Task Forces reported maneuvering far off the Philippines some days ago were approaching the islands close enough to penetrate into the outer Nippon patrol areas around the end of December, but were warded off by Japanese air activity.</blockquote>								<p>The News, in fact, is that Mac's planes sunk eight Japanese ships including a destroyer in the Lingayen Gulf for the loss of no planes.  As Yamashita's troops continue their flight from Manila, American warships are rapidly approaching northern Luzon.  There's much concern, however, about some naval troops that have stayed behind, perhaps to fight a rearguard action.  Everyone in the city is on the alert.  Some fear a bloodbath is due.</p>								<p>The Editorial and Maharajah again suggest that people should move out of Manila.  So Icasiano is still toeing the Japanese line even now, or else he knows something we don't: "<i>Unfortunately, we are not free to give the exact reasons in support of this suggestion</i>."  The fact is evacuation is simply unfeasible; Manilans are ready to ride it out and can't wait to get it over and done with.  Only today Figueras told Manuel Sotelo "confidentially" to not leave Manila. </p>								<p></p>								<p></p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
