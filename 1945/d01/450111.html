Our air units are likewise continuing their sure-hit death charges on enemy aircraft and other vessels.</blockquote>								<p>George, Maurice, Freddie and I walked downtown to exchange some money; the best we could get was 65:1.  We bought some bananas, paying P4 for small and P7 for medium size, and eyed the dynamite strapped around each pillar under the Jones Bridge — the only bridge open today.</p>								<p>The Japanese have barricaded the Heacock Building, intending to fight there and in Echague Street.  In Ermita they've been felling trees, overturning trucks and stashing antitank dynamite charges in creeks.  People are staying home to avoid being called for forced labor.</p>								<p>Minor looting continued downtown, and the Japanese have been shooting at some of them.  A few looters in Manga Avenue were chased away by residents with the aid of some Japanese communication men from Piña Street.  Figueras is said to have helped himself to one truck, 3 bikes, 3 oil drums and other stuff.  Abandoned houses are being taken apart for firewood.  A few "Home Guards" have been seen carting off loot too.  La Vanguardia announced that rice can now enter Manila freely — now that there's no transportation.</p>								<p>Convoys of two or three trucks and cars have been rushing back and forth from San Mateo.  As the Japanese moved their wounded in, the people there have been moved out and in some cases dumped near the Santa Mesa Bridge.  The Japanese have also been exploring the trails behind San Mateo leading into the mountains.</p>								<p>News: The Americans have taken San Fabian, Mangaldan, Dagupan and Lingayen without serious opposition.  Supplies are already pouring ashore while the Japanese speak of two American convoys on their way with 80 large transports and 120 to 150 ships including warships.  Yamashita's troops continue heading north to Baguio and the Cordillera Mountains.</p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
