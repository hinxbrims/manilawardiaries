In two weeks MacArthur's losses totaled 657 killed, 187 missing and 2,201 wounded versus 6,449 Japanese killed, 423 captured and 7,000-plus wounded — few enough to surmise that a major battle has yet to be fought.  I hope it won't be in this city.</p>								<p>A concrete wall with two firing slits replaced the corner plate glass in the Heacock Building; the pillbox in front is gone.  Japanese defenses include the San Miguel Brewery, an anti-tank barrier on General Solano leading to the Ayala spans, plus "heavy" defenses on Taft Avenue.  Santa Mesa might still be safe.</p>								<p>Some 30 to 50 Japanese trucks loaded with stuff came into Manila from Marikina way.  They must have gone north because they didn't go south through the Jones Bridge.  I hope the trucks were meant FOR Manila!</p>								<p>I'm paying Villareal P200 military plus P1 genuine every four hours to fix the radio.  Walked to the Escolta to buy 18 magazines at very high prices and get a part for my Elgin radio. So it's off to bed early after a tiring day.  A beautiful moon's out that will be full in a few days.  Many hoped that MacArthur would arrive on his birthday tomorrow.  Maybe by the full moon, they now say.</p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
