The Japanese continue to resist in places that have been taken, and ships here and there continue to be blasted or damaged but not sunk.</p>								<p>"Makapili men attack enemy ... with fixed bayonets, causing heavy casualties among the Americans" (Lingayen, January 27).  The Makapili were not identified.</p>								<p>"Nadisco looting probe started" â€” on the January 14 and 15 lootings.  Special Prosecutor Arturo Tolentino is disgusted because all the entities and officials are washing their hands and shifting the blame to others.</p>								<p>On the road from Manila to Calumpit, a P-38 strafed a jitney carrying military notes.  Two or three Japanese on board ran for safety as the jitney caught fire.  When they didn't return, Filipinos nearby made a dash for the notes.  Villareal's brother-in-law got over P200,000, another got P155,000 and more went to other hands.  The notes I saw were slightly burned but usable.</p>								<p>A Manila "journalist" slipped through to MacArthur and gave him the lowdown on the pathetic conditions at Manila.  Explosions continue in the city and two big fires are burning in the Port Area.  The Japanese once said that all Manila had suffered at the hands of USAFFE dynamiters, but compared to the Japanese the USAFFE were timid.  The sporadic shooting we hear is on the increase.  A Japanese sentry recently shot a Home Guard.  The Filipino had misinterpreted his instructions and went on patrol during curfew.</p>								<p>San Fernando liberated; American patrols have already gone five miles further.  Casualties since the landings have been relatively light.  Japanese killed are over the 25,000 mark while the Americans have suffered 1,107 killed, 197 missing and 3,040 wounded.  The railroad from Lingayen is already carrying 1,000 tons of supplies daily.  Also apparent is a clear gap between Yamashita's forces and the naval people "defending" Manila.</p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
