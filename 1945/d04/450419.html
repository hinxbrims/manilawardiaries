Yesterday, Roxas dropped in next door to visit MacArthur, whose guards, incidentally, have been tripled today.</p>								<p>Excerpt of Romulo's address to Congress:</p>								<blockquote>Every street has its tragic story.  All is rubble created in an insane attempt to obliterate a city that represents to the Japanese the faith of oriental people in America....  The walls of Manila scream with the agony of those brave Filipinos whose only crime was loyalty.</blockquote>								<p>I fail to see how it helps us.  Manila is running a temperature; it's sicker now than before the Americans entered, and that's no exaggeration.  The food situation is worsening; rice is insufficient, and tinned fish and pork and beans just aren't enough, besides creating a certain strain in the palate, if you get what I mean.  Spiritually too, we are all suffering.  Families are in a continual squabble about their girls being out at all times with the GIs; and the girls are earning more than the men for doing hardly anything.  The test for unneeded stenographers includes prettiness and fairness â€” qualities that could get them higher salaries and perks.  Meanwhile, the boys are complaining about army racketeering while most of the stuff is going to the girls.  Before, there was hardly any food but people had money.  Now there's more food, but it's still expensive and there's no money.  Still, Newsweek's bar-room perspective will continue to report that Manila is <i>happily</i> rebuilding.</p>						</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
