Language teachers have assigned the topic for class compositions in order to compile <i>authentic</i> atrocity stories.  Fine stories they'll be too, I bet.</p>								<p>"Woman tells how Japanese police used her home as torture chamber."  Mary Seiden couldn't bear the cries of agony emanating from her Justo Street house at Cavite.  She actually saw men hog-tied and thrown on the floor like pigs.  Says the Japanese intended to blow up the house because she found sticks of dynamite under it.</p>								<p>"Manila surgeon tells how Japs murdered whole families in Pasay."  Walter K. Frankel, a Doctor of Medicine at the U.P., was in a group with his wife, sister, Justice Villareal and others that were tied and taken to some apartment.  Forced to kneel facing the wall, the Japanese piled furniture and cushions around them, splashed gasoline and ignited the lot with grenades.  Anyone who moved was shot, but as usual, a few managed to escape.  After the Americans saved him, guerrillas temporarily detained him as a suspected spy.</p>								<p>On my way home I stopped at the market for some fish, but they all looked terrible.  Sure enough, good fish was being hidden from the inspectors and you had to ask for it.  I did ... and ended up paying seven times the official "Controlled Price"!</p>						</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
