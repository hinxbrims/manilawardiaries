Two doctors with well-developed practices here have lost all but the goodwill of their patients.  At their age, they don't feel they should abandon everything and start from zero again back home.  Does rehabilitation only apply to Filipinos?  Since the liberation of Santo Tomas, the Dutch have been getting P100 a month retroactive to last October; the British got £20 and £10; the Americans ... nil.</p>								<p>And speaking of aid, what about us men (especially the bachelors) who are in a pretty dire spot?  There has never been a blitz like this.  The girls get the jobs, the pay, the invitations to parties, dances, picnics, meals, ice cream, Jeep-rides ... you name it.  The local boys are broke, without a car, job or prospects, and unable to compete with the goodies showered by the Sixth Army.  As for families, they can't get domestic help because the girls are all working as nightclub entertainers.</p>								<p class = "center">. . . .</p>								<p>At 1130 this morning, Mrs. Connor, Frances, Ma and I attended a little tea party Mrs. MacArthur gave for us.  She's quite a charming lady: aged forty to fifty, a little on the tanned side (as is little Arthur) but fair, quick to set you at ease, quicker to talk and inclined to monopolize the conversation.  She talked faster than anyone I've ever heard except for some Spaniards.  We talked about prewar mutual friends, and Major Graham took note when I said that Arthur used to play with the Graemigers at the Manila Hotel and with the Feltmans too.  So Arthur will be going to the Graemigers tomorrow and the visit will be reciprocated.</p>								<p>Speaking of Arthur, he's getting a pony tomorrow, and so is Major Graham, who taught him to ride.  Arthur just turned seven two months ago so he's still a bit on the shy side.  He looked like he had been taking Atabrine for a while, which is curious because he spent 2-1/2 years in Australia and not New Guinea.</p>						</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
