This heroine is working for an insurance company and pays to go downtown and back despite the fact that she could easily get jeep rides.</p>								<p>She recalled an incident at the Remedios Hospital.  One day, about 20 to 25 Japanese brought their wounded Captain to the hospital, and Nenuca thinks they represented practically all the Japanese in that area!  She stood her ground, insisting that they couldn't bring their weapons into the hospital.  Lo and behold, the Japanese talked it over and left two men outside to guard their weapons.  They left later without incident.  <i>What?  No atrocities?</i>  Oh yes, every time she stepped out of the hospital to evacuate patients, which presumably occurred some time later, the Japanese took pot shots at her despite her uniform and red cross arm-band.</p>								<p>After some 18 or 19 days of heroic work, fagged out and scarcely able to keep her eyes open, she took a big gulp from a bottle of tonic that someone offered her.  Too late, she realized it was creoline.  The medics went to work on her.  She stuck it out for four days more, but her stomach was in chaos, and finally, with some reluctance, she let herself be sent to the safe north side for care.</p>								<p>Regarding the Japanese around Remedios, she said: "<i>Golly, if we just had our wits about us and no patients to take care of, we could have wiped them out ourselves</i>."  I recall Manolo Cartagena told me the same thing: there were only about 30 Japanese in the four blocks, and they were more scared than he was.</p>						</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
