Independence is a 'settled issue.'"  He said the sugar situation was critical.  Take the case of the Roxas Hacienda in Nasugbu.  In 1942, the Japanese forced them to devote half their acreage to cotton despite protests that it wouldn't work.  But no, Japanese agricultural experts could do anything — except cultivate cotton as it turned out.  It'll be planting time soon but seedlings are lacking and what's available is of poor quality.  So there'll be no milling next winter; the harvest will be used for next year's seedlings.  And to cap it all, after three years without fertilizers (the Japanese took that too), the hacienda faces a re-soiling program.</p>								<p>Jobs are available for laborers and ladies.  Salaries aren't fixed for the latter, so the competition is fierce.  They go for a test, qualify, but better salaries are offered elsewhere so they go there for another test, qualify ... then comes the Navy.  "<i>What?</i>" they sneer.  "<i>The Army won't give you food?  No transportation?  Well, we can do better than that</i>."</p>								<p>Maurice could only get an offer of a mess-boy job at the Navy at P1.45 a day with room and board.  "<i>It's your government</i>," said the officer.  "<i>We pay what they order us to.  And I don't understand, myself, how anyone could live on that</i>."  The Army has an oversupply of non-fighting Americans doing jobs that Filipinos could easily do.  The Army is also throwing away most of its equipment.  You can buy almost anything in town for a price, including brand new Delco Army batteries.  I saw one today: 21 plates and P135 being used on a 12-year-old jitney.</p>								<p>Today Mrs. MacArthur took Arthur and his new friends to see the ruins on the south side, and to turn the ride into a real treat, suffered herself to be taken along on a jeep ride.
