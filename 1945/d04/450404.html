All told, 400 found dead "for four or five days" in three places; the majority with hands tied behind their backs.</p>								<p>In another group, three live Filipino civilians were found.  One of a group of 58 Tuberculosis patients brought there from the hospital said: "<i>Whenever one of the civilians asked for water or food, he was bayoneted by the Japs</i>."</p>								<p>A third group:</p>								<blockquote>In the 15 by 18 feet dungeon were some 300 bodies.  It was impossible to detect any wounds on the partially decomposed bodies, and there was every indication that they had died of starvation.</blockquote>								<p>More likely died of thirst in the bombproof dungeon — but 300 in that small space?  It's the most condemning proof of Japanese atrocities.</p>								<p>PLN quotes Enrique J.C. Montilla, Vice-President and General Manager of the Isabela Sugar Central:</p>								<blockquote>There are no prospects of immediate sugar production ... in the Philippines, because virtually all the sugar centrals ... have been ravaged by the Japs.  The Japs destroyed some, the guerrilleros [destroyed] others to prevent the Japs from getting alcohol.  Sugar seedlings are available in limited quantities only.</blockquote>								<p>Frances and Mrs. Connor dropped in for lunch.  Major Graham, a Southern gentleman and little Arthur's swimming teacher, offered to take us to visit Mrs. MacArthur.  As the wife of the Commander-in-Chief, Mrs. MacArthur keeps herself busy with hospital visits and such though she tries to stay out of the limelight.</p>								<p>Col. Crossen at the wedding of Capt. Posten, where the bride wore a dress made of silk from a Japanese parachute: "<i>I'm sorry, Captain, that I have but one gift to offer you.  It's all I have, but I take pleasure in being able to present it to you now ... the RIPCORD</i>."</p>						</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
