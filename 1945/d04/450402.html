The following note-book-diary, presumably belonging to a member of the Akatsuki 16,700 Force, was captured in Manila by troops of the U.S. XIV Corps:</p>								<blockquote>Feb.7, 1945: 150 guerrillas were disposed of tonight.  I personally stabbed and killed ten.</blockquote>								<blockquote>Feb.8: Guarded over 1,164 guerrillas who were newly brought in today.</blockquote>								<blockquote>Feb.9, 1945: Burned 1,000 guerrillas to death tonight.</blockquote>								<blockquote>Feb.10: Guarded approximately 1,000 guerrillas.</blockquote>								<blockquote>Feb.13: Enemy tanks here are lurking in the vicinity of Banzai Bridge<sup>†</sup>.  Our attack preparation has been completed.  I am now on guard duty at guerrilla internment camp.  While I was on duty approximately ten guerrillas tried to escape.  They were stabbed to death.  At 1600, all guerrillas were burned to death.</blockquote>								<p>Here's a second document from a "captured file of Manila Naval Defense Force and Southwest Area Fleet Operations Order dated December 23, 1944, to February 14, 1945, classified 'secret' — presumably belonging to the OKADA unit":</p>								<blockquote>When the Filipinos are to be killed, they must be gathered into one place and disposed of with the consideration that ammunition and man-power must not be used in excess.  Because the disposal of death bodies is a troublesome task they should be gathered into houses which are scheduled to be burned or demolished.  They should be thrown into the rivers.</blockquote>								<blockquote>All people on the battlefield, with the exception of Japanese Military personnel, Japanese civilians, and Special Construction Units will be put to death.</blockquote>								<p>The Editorial, "How the Japs Kill the Filipinos," clearly says that the Battalion Order was issued on February 13, and "found in a bound file of the MDF [Manila Defense Force] and SWA Sea Fleet Operating Orders."  No doubt many guerrillas were executed, but "all people in the battlefield" certainly weren't put to death.</p>								<p>Congressman Miguel Tolentino of Batangas "proposed the 'execration of Japan and the Japanese'" [from the Philippines], and suggested an Executive Order "imposing a tax on excess profits made during the Japanese Occupation."</p>								<p class="footnote"><sup>† </sup>Jones Bridge</p>						</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
