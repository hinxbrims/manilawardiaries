Her wound was almost identical to Father Cosgrave's — shrapnel, I judged, because Solita didn't even know what caused it.  Paul Meyer quipped: "<i>Better tell Henry the story, he's going to write a book</i>."</p>								<p>She told me that the refugees at San Agustin numbered 5,000, and when I jumped at the figure, she said she would ask her in-laws for the best possible estimate.  On their last day, about 300 died at San Agustin ... "<i>due to a hand grenade</i>."  Now please follow me:</p>								<p class="dialogA">— "A hand grenade?"</p>								<p class="dialogB">— "I ... I think so."</p>								<p class="dialogA">— "A hand grenade can't kill more than ten or twenty," I said gently.</p>								<p class="dialogB">— "I don't know what it was ... it sure raised a lot of dust and smoke."</p>								<p class="dialogA">— "Maybe it was a bomb thrown in," I suggested.</p>								<p class="dialogB">— "Maybe."</p>								<p class="dialogA">— "Did you see the Jap that threw it?"</p>								<p class="dialogB">— "No, I don't know what it was."</p>								<p>So the Japanese didn't throw hand grenades there; something went in and exploded, killing many ... probably an American shell.  So how did they get out?</p>								<p class="dialogB">— "Well, on Friday the Japs told us to evacuate to the Letran Building, so we left, led by only the four men left: Iquenza, a politician who did a great job of calming us, a Home Guard and two doctors.  The rest of us trailed — and what a trail it was — the well, the sick, the weak, the wounded and even the dying.  Iquenza had a white flag but the Japs kept shooting..."</p>								<p class="dialogA">— "At you?"</p>								<p class="dialogB">— "They killed Iquenza when he was only two steps from freedom."</p>								<p class="dialogA">— "The Americans were at Letran?"</p>								<p class="dialogB">— "Before Letran."</p>								<p class="dialogA">— "So actually, the Japs had sent you to your freedom."</p>								<p class="dialogB">— "Yes ... I guess so."</p>								<p class="dialogA">— "But as you left they shot at you?"</p>								<p class="dialogB">— "Well, the shooting went on — my knees buckled — I could hardly walk....  Yes, there was shooting all over."</p>								<p class="dialogA">— "If the Japs wanted to kill you there on the street, it would have been an easy matter.  I doubt they were shooting to kill you."</p>								<p>I left it at that because she needed a rest.  Her story reminded me of the Spanish diary the Connors showed me of a nun that ran from February 2 to 22.  At San Agustin on the 20th, she wrote: "<i>Not in one instant did the terrible bangs of the cannons or the fearful grenades stop</i>."  My guess is that she too couldn't tell the difference between a shell and a hand grenade.</p>								<p class="center">. . . .</p>								<p style="text-align: right" class="inLink"><br><a href="450228c.html"> continues...</a></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
