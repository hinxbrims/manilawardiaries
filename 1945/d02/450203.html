				<p class="first">The Battle of Manila is fast approaching as MacArthur's forces take shape.  The original force is about 20 air miles from Manila approaching Malolos, while another force made a sensational rush from Guimba to about 24 miles from Manila down the eastern highway from Cabanatuan.  Then we've got the forces driving from Subic to just 7 miles from part of the first group, plus the Nasugbu contingent's 9-mile advance.  The first two groups could arrive anytime, but it will be several days before they are here in force.</p>
				
				<p>Announcing that they would leave our neighborhood at 1700 today, the Japanese started a bonfire of auto tires and stuff on Piña Street.  Maurice Klingler walked over and the Japanese gave him three brand new tires.  A disappointed man is Kreill — he had his eye on four gasoline drums that the Japanese had placed in his garage, but a couple of soldiers punctured the drums in the last minute.  The whole of Manga Avenue reeked of precious gasoline.  And if that's a waste, then so is the Japanese truck loaded with beer that passed by Santa Mesa Extension heading for Marikina-Montalban, where four P-38s wheeled around like buzzards looking for a place to roost — or roast. </p>
				
				<p>Speaking of fires, the Japanese started a colossal one yesterday at 1100 in <a href="../../mapper/escolta.html">Reina Regente</a> — Manila's wholesale section.  Hundreds and hundreds of brand new aviation tires and stuff from a bodega there burned from 1100 until 0230 this morning.</p>
				
				<p>A Japanese big shot in this district said his good-byes to a neighbor, warning him to "<i>store plenty of water</i>" because the reservoir in Montalban had been mined.  So the Japanese are prepared to deny water to a million residents of the city to hurt several thousand Americans!  Meanwhile, Tokyo keeps up the pretense that Filipinos are pro-Japanese, while her soldiers childishly hope the Americans will get the blame for the ensuing suffering.</p>
				
				<p>Anyway, it seems that we shall be free of Japanese in this district tonight, and that means no sentries.  This leaves the mostly unarmed Constabulary to keep guard.  Last night, robbers tried to break into the Sotelos but were spotted early and shouted out.  A mob of rowdy looters showed up as soon as the Japanese abandoned their houses in Piña and Manga Avenue.  An armed Home Guard scattered them by firing a shotgun into the air.  The Guards worked hard to clear the area of non-union looters, if you know what I mean.  The looting is over now — the houses have been cleaned out by...er, the union men.</p>
				
				<p>Pointing to a passing gang led by a man wearing white shoes, a bystander said, "<i>There's the boss there ... Figueras' chauffeur</i>."  The gang sure knew how to work.  I think they even got away with a piano.  The attitude here is realistic: No one can stop the looting of unoccupied premises, so go ahead then leave us in peace.  The same is happening in other areas abandoned by the Japanese.  The shame is not that Japanese goods are being stolen, but the houses too are stripped of everything but the foundations.  We're headed for one swell climax — the enemies within causing as much damage as the war itself.</p>
