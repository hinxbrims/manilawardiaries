"<em>So what do the pro-Japanese say about it all?</em>" asked Mrs. Sotelo sarcastically.</p>								<p>"<i>Oh, but there aren't any pro-Japs now</i>," replied the lady with simulated equanimity.</p>								<p>"<em>Yes there are</em>," answered Mrs. Sotelo, "<em>and their names are with the CIC</em>."  Well, we all hope so, of course.</p>								<p class="center">. . . .</p>								<p>Skirmishes continue in Intramuros and part of the Port Area where the Americans landed to attack the Japanese from the rear.  We had some dive-bombing and shelling of Intramuros, but by 1830 all was quiet.  The Manila Hotel is partly liberated, and the High Commissioner's Palace was freed one or two days ago.  For all I know, it's over 48 hours since any Japanese shell hit Manila.  An American tank was destroyed as late as yesterday morning â€” probably by a mine on Herran.</p>								<p>Socially and economically, Manila is DEAD.  We have no water, gas, electricity, telephone or mail service; no transportation, markets (except street vendors), stores or banks; and very little money.  The PCAU rationing is about to burst a lung though supplies should arrive soon.  And still there's hardly any contact between the north and south Manila.  Despite all this, people are calm and not bitter.  Wailing against the Japanese is now ancient history.  People still talk about their experiences but hardly anyone listens anymore.  With a long, tough, grind ahead before normalcy returns, they are staying cool, keeping worries to themselves and getting ready to jump at the first chance of getting work.  Fortunately the Battle of Destruction is almost over; the Battle of Reconstruction has now begun.</p>								<p>Armed with a list of names and a pass from Col. Grimm, I'm crossing into South Manila tomorrow on a hunt for missing Santo Tomas internees.</p>								<p class="center">...ooOoo...</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
