				<p class="first">About 12 Japanese infiltrated into Nagtahan last night, and a real little war began until they were killed off.  This morning I saw about 100 Americans closing in on several Japanese hiding in dugouts in the field behind <a href="../../mapper/sanmig.html">San Beda</a>.  Traffic was being stopped from time to time, but I went through with a cynical smile.  Any Japanese dumb enough to shoot me would be cooking his own goose.  He'd probably miss anyway, assuming he still had a rifle.</p>
				
				<p>On the way to Ermita and Malate after the bridge at the corner of <a href="../../mapper/paco.html">Otis and Isaac Peral</a>, I got off my bike and watched about six GIs around a little grassy mound in the open field.  Some Japanese were trapped inside a short mound with only one exit.  Two GIs with drawn pistols yelled for them to come out.  No one appeared.  After a couple of minutes, a GI fired several rounds.  Still no one appeared, so the process was repeated.  The two GIs then opened fire for a third time and a minute later one moved in.  He pulled out 2 dead Japanese soldiers — their faces still wet with perspiration.  I decided to move on — a sniper from somewhere was shooting a bullet now and then and the entire street looked eerily deserted.</p>
				
				<p>Manila Bay is full of supply ships today on Osmeña's first day as President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines.  I didn't go to the ceremony but I could've gotten in with the Sotelos who knew Confesor well.  George gave me a good description of the event.  He said that Mac was practically crying at the end of his speech.  With tears in his eyes too, old man Sotelo did something impulsive towards the end.  As the General walked by, he stepped forward, grabbed his hand and said, "<i>It's been three long years ... thank God it's over</i>."  And so saying, kissed MacArthur's hand.  None of the Osmeña sons were present — only the women.  Among the civilians were Maximo Kalaw and Madrigal, whose relations with the Japanese are making things embarrassing for him.  I'm told that no one spoke to him, but it's typical of the situation here that he was invited at all. </p>
