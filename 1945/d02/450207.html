I went to the porch, and after satisfying myself that we were not in danger, traced the source to around Quezon City, possibly targeting the tanks parked around here including two in Manga Avenue.  The shells whistled ominously before they exploded LOUDLY.  Maurice thought an American battery in España was targeting a lumberyard just south of us.  Looking at the haggard expressions around here, I chose not to pass that information on.</p>								<p>A bit after noon the tanks left towards Santol.  I believe they'll be crossing to the other side of the river soon.  Everyone here got a good look, particularly at Sergeant Clark's Crusader.  One of them intermittently fired at alleged Japanese positions in San Juan, beginning a fire that the boys said was a Japanese oil tank but was nothing of the sort.  Several houses near Japanese positions by the San Juan Bridge caught fire — that's all.</p>								<p>Preparations for a new battle I'm calling the Battle of Central Manila started in Pureza this morning with much bustling as ten-wheeled trucks brought supplies in.  The skirmish started around 1600 as both sides tentatively felt each other out.  Then heavy artillery opened up, far surpassing yesterday's activity on San Juan.  A large fire broke out in the Pandacan-Pasig boat-building sector — exclusively Japanese property, I'm happy to report.</p>								<p>The Japanese just now fired four shells into this area, one of which hit a tree and slit off a branch.  I was in Buenos Aires with Rollie Garriz, the only saps in this neighborhood foolish enough to be out walking.  The burst drove us down Buenos Aires.  We walked on and met Gonzalez, Manoling La'O, Fernando Perez and the Ygoas — "charlando" as the Spanish say — talking and having a good time, careless if you please, but with an ear trained for any whistling shells.</p>								<p>None of us know anything definite — we've heard no official news.  Reports say the Japanese are shelling the Americans from the strong concrete City Hall and U.P. buildings using antiaircraft guns and shells as ordinary artillery.  One such shell killed four Americans around San Sebastian.</p>								<p>Last Monday evening, the Japanese with the aid of the Makapili went to the City Hall, called up the Police Force, interned them and executed them by the bayonet.  A policeman recognized and authorized by the Americans to carry arms said three of the thirty escaped — a Major, a Lieutenant and a Sergeant.</p>								<p>Fritz Kaufmann said MacArthur paid a visit to Santo Tomas.  He said that only 39 members of Santo Tomas died last month.</p>								<p class="center">. . .</p>								<p style="text-align: right" class="inLink"><br><a href="450207b.html"> continues...</a></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
