Manga Avenue had been lucky so far but there's still a danger of Japanese shells falling here.  The fighting in Intramuros was "<i>heavy ... with many casualties</i>."</p>								<p>— "<em>Civilians?</em>"  I asked.</p>								<p>— "<i>I don't know</i>," said Duran impatiently, "<i>all he said was many casualties ... many Japs there</i>."</p>								<p>— "<em>How many?</em>"</p>								<p>— "<i>30,000</i>."</p>								<p>— "<em>W-What?</em>" I said, astonished.</p>								<p>— "<i>That's what he said</i>."</p>								<p>Perhaps he meant civilians, I thought, but even that was improbable.  I pressed him, but Duran held his ground and Margot confirmed it.  Dunckel said the Japanese retreated from the outskirts into the south of Manila.  Excluding Intramuros, he estimated their numbers at 60-70,000.  MacArthur had at last issued carte blanche to bomb and shell the whole southern half of the city if need be, said Dunckel.  <i>There is no other recourse ... we have to do it</i>. </p>								<p class ="center">. . . .</p>								<p>A word about an inconceivable subject.  Mr. Siy told me that a Chinese escaped from Intramuros with a report that the Japanese were executing anyone and everyone seen on the streets, including women and children.  Others said the Japanese even entered homes and executed the males for no reason.  Dunckel described it as indiscriminate and mass execution.  I am not quite ready to believe it yet.</p>								<p>Dunckel confirmed the poor condition of the 511 POWs from Cabu, and told of another 400 healthy prisoners freed from Tarlac province.  When the Lieutenant of the latter group saw the 800 ships off Lingayen, he supposedly exclaimed: "<i>This is what I have been waiting for</i>."  Then he dropped dead.</p>								<p>I couldn't help compare Dunckel with Walsh, the over-wrought General and the happy-go-lucky Irish Captain — two extremes.  I'm siding with the latter as to the number of Japanese in Intramuros and the safety of Manga Avenue.</p>								<p>2130: A relatively quiet night.  Now and then American shells hurtle over the river into Intramuros — but the activity is in slow motion.</p>								<p class ="center">...ooOoo...</p>						</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
