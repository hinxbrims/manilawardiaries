On three occasions, the Japanese called everyone out and lined them up in front of bayonets, warning that if they found a single guerrillero or weapon it was good-bye for all.  Three times, 1,000 civilians were called out, lined up and threatened while the Japanese searched every room in the building, but not a single one was killed.  This was the Japanese at the other end of the pendulum.</p>								<p>When American shells started hitting the apartments, the people at the Elena fled for all points of the compass — some to safety, others straight into the cauldron.  Others wandered in during the lulls only to continue their flight when the shelling resumed.  Ray eventually moved to <a href="../../_maps/ermita.html">St. Paul's</a> and the American rear lines.</p>								<blockquote><i>What the Japs didn't burn, American shelling did.  I spoke to several American officers and they admitted as much.  They said it just had to be done — otherwise progress would have been extremely costly and so much delayed that civilian casualties would have been correspondingly larger</i>.</blockquote>								<p>The ordeal suffered by civilians during the Battle of Manila is reported here only piece-meal.  One can only imagine the terror as groups rushed here and there amidst the shells.  In the midst of one of the greater melees, one woman entered a crowded shelter with two dogs on a double-ended leash, leaving cash and valuables behind, to the dismay of her husband.  According to one version, she was clutching a tin box until her husband finally "liberated" it, but his joy was short-lived as it contained only dog biscuits.  He almost went insane watching the dogs enjoy their biscuits while he suffered from misery and hunger — until he couldn't stand it anymore.  To make a long story short, I understand the dogs are still alive and healthy, but the husband, it's said, barks occasionally.</p>								<p class="center">...ooOoo...</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
