				<p class="first">Out on the rear porch, I can see that the Japanese batteries are firing right into the fire — and it's spreading rapidly.  I'd call it a holocaust now.  By 2000, two large fires raged on the north side of Manila: the old one that started around 1300 and the new one barely 40 minutes old.</p>				
				
				<p>Ferrer is in charge of the guerrillas in Domingo Santiago — barely 200 yards away — while 50 yards from me are three Japanese guarding a house on Piña Street.  The guerrillas have driven up and down Santa Mesa on a jitney with an American flag but always pulled up short at the top of this hill, which leads to Piña-Sociego and Manga Avenue.  Many have been asking why they didn't "get" the outnumbered Japanese.</p>
				
				<p>The Liberator Magazine today put out a one-page special edition today containing two messages for the Liberators and the Filipino people.  The first message welcomed MacArthur; the second explained how we could "help the army of liberation":</p>
				
				<blockquote>First: Watch out for Japanese and Filipino saboteurs [who] are causing many of the fires here in Manila.</blockquote>
				
				<blockquote>Second: Watch closely the movements and hideouts of all those whom you know for a certainty to have been working as spies or collaborators to the Japanese, and report such findings to the investigating body that shall take charge of such affairs in the Philippines.</blockquote>
				
				<blockquote>Third: As much as possible keep to your houses until the all clear is given.</blockquote>
				
				<p>The issue must've been printed nearby and distributed to everyone — no need at last to fear former collaborators and spies, who in fact have suddenly become the most ardent of pro-Americans.  A few of them were even seen distributing the Liberator today!</p>
				
				<p class="center">. . .</p>
				
				<p><b>2005</b>: No light, no water, no electricity, no telephone, no newspaper, no radio, no order, no transportation, no nothing — only sporadic machine-gunning more to the east of the Pasig River.</p>
				
				<p><b>2014</b>: I was talking when I noticed a flash through the crack of the door.  I got up instantly for a look when ... BOOMRHHH ... a terrific explosion shook the earth.  We've had about 15 of these in a row now adding fuel to the fire.  The one at the right seems to be in Rizal Avenue where the famous <a href="../../mapper/sanlazaro_det.html">San Lazaro Hospital</a> is — the same one where civilian corpses are reported to be piling up.  Dad's yelling in the porch....  WOW!  A record earthquake — reverberations resounding throughout the whole city.</p>
