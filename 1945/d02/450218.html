Hillcrest on the northeast outskirts received a drubbing from Marikina and points further east.  One shell scored a direct hit on Prieur, the Ford Motor Company's Frenchman in Manila, while he was in his air raid shelter.  Apparently there was not much left of him, but his wife and two children are still alive. </p>								<p>The Japanese gave Santa Mesa its heaviest mortar shelling from Marikina today — some 65 to 70 shells around 0730 as people made their way to an already crowded church.  There were no casualties.  Windows rattled and shrapnel landed all around including Manga Avenue.  Many commented at the high number of American soldiers attending the Mass.  They were placing dollar bills on the collection plates — a big help for Father Gil.</p>								<p>I had lunch at Santo Tomas where I helped carry Father Cosgrave's cot into the hospital as his fever was up again.  I noticed many American doctors, all Captains in the Medical Corps, weren't busy at all — a sure sign that field hospitals aren't overflowing with American casualties.  There was no shortage of food, cigarettes and candy rations.</p>								<p>So many people of different nationalities continue to enter the Camp as guests that the Committee will meet to discuss that tonight.  They are asking internees for a list of those who helped the Camp in the past, as the Camp is willing to return the good deeds but can't allow everybody in, and there are false claimants around.</p>								<p>The lid is off on censorship.  Correspondents are now allowed to write about atrocities and Japanese brutality.  I saw one dispatch, and though it spoke the truth, I felt it was inadequately presented.</p>								<p class="center">. . . .</p>								<p>And so the third week of this tragic Battle begins.  The Japanese may lose 15,000 men, the Americans 1,500 and the civilians 50,000.  Hearing of this, the Americans express extreme regret, throw in another regiment, promptly lose 18 more men then decide it's too costly.  So back they go to the old hide and seek game, giving the Japanese more time while the civilians suffer.  No wonder MacArthur's communiqués dwell on the Japanese defense of Manila, captured documents, and so on.  Meanwhile, non-combatant American technicians, engineers and soldiers talk mostly of American losses — "<i>150 attacked here and only 68 came back, see?</i>"  Sorry but I'm a little deaf.</p>								<p style="text-align: right" class="inLink"><br><a href="450218b.html"> continues...</a></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
