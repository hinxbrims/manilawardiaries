Given up for dead long ago, her saga is a phenomenal episode of survival and rescue from the ashes of the Walled City.  She has shrapnel injuries on her left shoulder and throat.  Two days ago she spotted and called me while receiving First Aid at Pandacan, but I didn't hear her.  Her story runs from her family's home to the split up of the men and women, thence to the Cathedral with her in-laws and on to San Agustin Church where the Spaniards were concentrated.</p>								<p>At noon today the electricity went on.  Looking forward to the evening news, I tested my radio, but three hours later the electricity was gone then the water went too.  At the White House on our right though, there's plenty of electricity and the boys are having a good time — swimming in the pool, playing billiards and bowling — even the Filipino maids are having a good time.  MacArthur was supposed to stay there tonight but he only stopped-by briefly.</p>								<p>Tonight's the second night of open-air movies at Santol.  At the same time, First Cavalry officers are scheduled to attend a dance in Santo Tomas — the second one since liberation.  Towards the Bay, flares are floating over the Walled City, and there's one fire around the Finance Building that I believe will be the last fire of the Battle of Manila.  A few Japanese are still holding out in two or three sturdy government buildings.  At 2030 I heard a couple of rifle shots 50 yards below us, and just before 2100 the heavy rumbling of American artillery drifted in from the east.</p>								<p class="center">...ooOoo...</p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
