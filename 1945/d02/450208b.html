I looked at him oddly: "<em>Why sleep, of course</em>."</p>								<p>"<i>Yes, yes</i>," he answered impatiently, "<i>but where?</i>"  I told him rather gently that in our house we all sleep in our beds, in our rooms, including Ma.  I didn't tell him that up to now we've taken no precautions because I suddenly felt foolish.  Most houses, you see, are on alert day and night — wet bags handy to stop fires, valises packed and practically on the porch, everyone ready for a quick getaway.  And quite a few are sleeping in their shelters, even passing part of the day there.  We don't even have one.</p>				<p>The best shelter in Manga Avenue is Ding Manotoc's — a miniature Maginot Fort used also by the La'Os, the Klinglers, Albertos and Boix.  The Sotelos' also shelters the Schultzes, Madariagas and others.  Ding's shelter could probably take a direct hit, but their year-old baby doesn't seem to like strange places so Mrs. Manotoc sleeps in her room and to hell with the war.  I sympathize with the kid because I can't stand being in a shelter for more than three minutes.</p>								<p>As to the danger in Manga Avenue, two Japanese shells landed in the yard of the Bernards — I inspected the craters myself.  Gus's house was slightly wounded; bullets have definitely hit the Garriz, Klingler and Manotoc houses, and a scattering of shrapnel has landed here and there.  No heavy shells have reached us; most whistle just above us as we live atop a hill.</p>								<p>Manila has been paralyzed since last Sunday — no utilities, services or food, no shops, no restaurants — and what money could you use anyway?  There's plenty of food around though — on the slightly overcooked side if you can find it.  All business has stopped.  People have started to reassemble their bicycles but they can't find anyone to repair tires and parts.  A bicycle mechanic who hangs his shingle up today would be swamped with business.</p>								<p class ="center">. . . .</p>								<p>It's now 1400 and it's been on the quiet side all day with spurts of machine gun and artillery fire here and there, and that's about all.  I checked out the ruins around town.  Man alive!  Blocks upon blocks upon blocks burned out; telephone poles and wires down; broken glass everywhere; debris all over the streets.  People were already cleaning up and salvaging their belongings; the homeless moving, no doubt hungry.  Houses were caved in, streets torn up, and big buildings thoroughly gutted.  Here and there by some miracle stood a house alone, a whole block unburned or a small district unscathed.</p>								<p style="text-align: right" class="inLink"><br><a href="450208c.html"> continues...</a></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
