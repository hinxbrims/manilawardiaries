Grimm withdrew my pass.  "<i>Nothing personal</i>," he explained, but orders are orders about crossing the river.  Grimm had been at his desk all night making preparations to clear the camp.  Some 400 left today for the U.S.A.  Word arrived from Los Baños that the internees there are all safe, except for two priests executed by the Japanese.</p>								<p>Ponce Enrile gave me an earful at the Connor shanty.  He'd seen Lily Raquiza in the Camp in uniform and wearing an armband designating some official status.  This staggered him, surprised me, and will fairly slay many guerrillas including the <i>Liberator</i> gang who had her on their black list.</p>								<p>Yesterday he saw Arturo Tolentino working for the Americans on the PCAU.  Literary stylist a-la-Japanese and ex-Special Prosecutor, Arturo is another one cottoning up to the Americans.  Ever the lawyer, Enrile cornered him and gave him a tongue-lashing.  "<i>Aw, let's forget all that</i>," said Tolentino, beating a hasty retreat.</p>								<p>Enrile saw Tomas Morato, Quezon's protégé some time ago, riding in a jeep with four or five Americans this morning.</p>								<blockquote>One day, I walked up to Tomas and had a few words with him.  You see, working at the Jai-Alai, I'm used to seeing him with the Japs and Benigno Aquino — in the money so to speak and having his own car in addition — and all this since his sojourn inside Fort Santiago.  Well ... that got my gander up so I asked him: 'Remember your old friend Quezon?'</blockquote>								<blockquote>Tomas said: 'Oh, Quezon!  Forget about him — he made a great mistake going with MacArthur.  If he'd have stayed, he'd have been a very great man in the Orient.'</blockquote>								<blockquote>That man was completely convinced that the Americans would never return.  Under those circumstances, the less I said and the less I knew him the better, so I left him right there.</blockquote>								<p>Enrile said that Pacita Del Rio was a Japanese spy before and during the occupation, and by inference, now.  "I can prove it," he said.  He gave Col. Grimm an earful on the subject and offered him and the CIC information, if and when it was needed.  But they would have to ask him for it.</p>								<p class="center">. . . .</p>								<p style="margin-top: -16px; text-align: right" class="inLink"><br><a href="450223b.html"> continues...</a></p>						</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
