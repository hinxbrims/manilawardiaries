Many there are calling the officials "suckers" because of all the people they've taken in.  One Alex Guterma is there with his wife and baby; the same Alex who made a lot of dough and lived grandly with even a horse and dokar during the occupation.  The officials have been nothing if not remarkably kind and merciful.  Manila was in chaos and it was a time for mercy first and questions later.  Internees are now busy writing up affidavits and some questions are now being asked.</p>								<p>Lucy Kyburz and son, Bobby, walked all the way from near the <a href="../../_maps/pasay.html">Polo Club in Pasay</a> to Santo Tomas via Taft Avenue — "<i>it's safe</i>."  She arrived at noon, hoping to take some of the belongings of her late husband home.  Earl Carroll, the indefatigable head of Santo Tomas, offered them some lunch but a humble Mrs. Kyburz tried to back out.  Fortunately, Mrs. Connor pressed luncheon tickets on them.  Not many people today would try to avoid a Santo Tomas feed.</p>								<p>Lucy's house had been partially destroyed by a few shells, near misses and shrapnel hits.  A fire started once but was quickly put out.  They spent most of the time huddled in their shelter with others while shells came "<i>from both sides</i>."  They had a well in their compound — a good thing too because the 11th Airborne were out of water when they drove into that area.  That's where the boys made a big splash with old Mrs. Kyburz.</p>								<p>On the subject of atrocities, Bobby began like everyone else, claiming that the Japanese did this, that and the other thing ... but nothing of the sort happened around them.  He thinks the Japanese defending Nichols didn't retreat towards the city; those near <a href="../../_maps/sth_malate.html">Vito Cruz and the Stadium</a> actually advanced toward the south, committing atrocities on the way.  Fortunately they didn't make it all the way to their area.</p>								<p class="center">. . . .</p>								<p>Guinto, Figueras, F.D. de la Rama and others are in Bilibid, and I'm happy to report that de la Rama isn't getting much care.  His right-hand-man, Chito Francisco, who brings him some food, says F.D. is thinner, hungry and "<i>boiling mad</i>," insisting his friendship with Osmeña and personal acquaintance with MacArthur will see him out soon.  I suspect it'll be a few years before that will happen.  The Americans in Bilibid think he's a bit nuts.</p>								<p style="text-align: right" class="inLink"><br><a href="450221b.html"> continues...</a></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
