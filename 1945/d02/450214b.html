At least the authorities seemed anxious to distribute food and were seeking any kind of Neighborhood Association Poll, perfect or not.  What a contrast with the Japanese who had almost perfect polls but used the discrepancies to stop distribution.  Being a battle zone, American Red Cross activities on the south side are negligible.  Elsewhere, the organization is struggling.  The best-organized group at the moment is the Chinese Association; the Swiss have only one cardboard sign at Nagtahan while the Spaniards have nothing.</p>								<p>The Americans invaded Manga Avenue today just like the Japanese did three years ago.  This afternoon two trucks brought MacArthur's belongings to the Casa Blanca, where he once stayed a few nights before evacuating to Bataan.  The three vacant houses at the dead end of our street have been occupied; the most looted one was converted into a repair yard of sorts in no time at all.</p>								<div class="image center" style="width: 406; margin-top: 15px; margin-left: 14px; margin-right: 6px">					<img src="casa_blanca_gate.jpg" border="0" width="406" height="330" alt="Casa Blanca Gate">					<div class="caption" style="margin-top: 7px">					Army staff at Casa Blanca Gate					</div>				</div>								<p>A couple of GIs cornered me today with their inquiries about Manila: "<i>Sa-ay, about this, er ... Death March we heard so much about, did all this happen, you know what I mean?</i>"  I said that I wasn't in the Death March but my brother Joe undoubtedly was and I still hoped to hear from him some day.  The stories were too detailed and gruesome to be exaggerated.</p>								<p></p>								<p></p>								<p></p>								<p class="center">...ooOoo...</p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
