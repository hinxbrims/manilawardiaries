Refugees from that area trudged in today ... dirty, weary, foot-sore, hungry, and unable to shake the terror that still stalks them.  The nice, peaceful and neighborly surroundings look surreal to them: "<i>Gee, this is paradise</i>," they say, amazed that the Santa Mesa Bridge is still intact.  "<i>In Paco, the Japanese blew up even the tiniest bridge</i>."  They've gone through hell, and we here are fully aware of our luck.  Meanwhile, so-called important persons and guerrilleros nearby are wasting scarce transportation by taking joy rides in autos, hurrying ostensibly on "official business": posing.</p>								<p>A Japanese sniper was caught alive in Isabel Street, Sampaloc.  The Americans turned him over to the guerrilleros, who bound his hands and feet, dragged him over gravel then carved him into pieces — all in front of a crowd and in daylight.  The rage against the Japanese here is uncontrollable.  Five days ago, Ygoa saw some Filipinos let two lost-looking Japanese walk by a safe distance before firing four shots at their back.  At the time, he "<i>burned</i>" at the "<i>cowardly act</i>."  In inimitable Spanish, he said: "<i>Since then I've changed my mind.  Shoot 'em from behind?  Hell, the Americans are too good to the bastards ... the Japanese have done worse to us</i>."  Anyway, the two soldiers continued down to the Santa Mesa Bridge, where guerrilleros put an end to their misery.</p>								<p>1130: Several huge explosions in the Port Area or <a href="../../_maps/intramuros.html">Walled City</a> sounding like mines going off in buildings ... "earthquakes" they were.  More going on now ... not sure what they are ... bombing?</p>								<p>Guerrillas captured a Makapili trying to set fire to the unoccupied house at the end of Manga Avenue.  He turned out to be the ex-houseboy of the Manga Avenue Kempeitai.  Guerrillas captured another 20 Makapili in this area and regions to the east of us.  I should've said "alleged" Makapili <i>and</i> guerrillas.</p>								<p>People have been making lots of sarcastic, caustic comments about Figueras' face-saving activities and his freedom and seeming invulnerability.  Current Japanese crimes of inhumanity raises all the more the guilt of those who in the last three years cooperated with them, voluntarily entertained them, got rich and lived off the fat of the land with them.  Justice must be done if the sacrifices of the dead and those who suffered fear, famine, torture and poverty are to be repaid in any way.</p>								<p>1906: What an afternoon!  Hundreds of refugees have been pouring in from Paco across the pontoon bridge in Nagtahan.  American Red Cross trucks have been sending the worst cases to hospitals while others walk in ... silent, homeless, bewildered, carrying their all, looking for missing brothers, sisters, or mourning for dead parents.  Some were hysterical, crying openly — but openly.  They all told stories of stark unbelievable tragedies, but let me stick to facts only.</p>								<p class="center">. . . .</p>								<p style="text-align: right" class="inLink"><br><a href="450211c.html"> continues...</a></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
