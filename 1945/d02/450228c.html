Matsuda, a regular, talkative guy, left for Baguio after saying goodbye to all and muttering something about a Northern Luzon defense and an escape to Formosa "<i>if necessary</i>."  Ozawa, an agent of Mizuno Sporting Goods, was quiet and peaceful.  He disappeared and was thought to have gone to Baguio too.  After an accident up north, he was rushed to the PGH.  Suffering from tetanus poisoning and realizing he was doomed, he contacted the De La Rivas probably to say goodbye.  He was already in a coma when they arrived.  Ozawa once questioned the De La Rivas about their building an air raid shelter.  "<i>It's no use ... worthless.  If the Americans enter, of all this</i>," he said, indicating the whole city with a wide sweep of his hand, "<i>nothing will remain</i>."</p>								<p>I was on the verge of going to the White House for a swim when the lights there went out, so I went to the movies instead — my first in many months.  I noticed quite a few soldiers having fun — actually they were quite drunk, noisy and disorderly.  This reminds me of an increasingly foul smell coming from the Quarter Master Corps.  The town is flooded with cigarettes; a house here and there is dependent on a "<i>Lieutenant</i>" or a "<i>Johnny</i>" — and boy does Johnny bring in the bacon!  Only six loaves of bread daily, a full box of rations, a tin of butter, canned fish....  Johnny gets all the rum and gin he wants and then some.  Even I can get just about anything I want from the White House; it's on offer in a friendly way.  A technician even took a whole box of rations out and parked it under a bush in our yard, exiting from our front gate through courtesy of yours truly because we keep our gates locked.</p>								<p>Well, at least none steal for the money.  I'd say that one in ten typically do it to exchange for liquor, six in ten to pose as big shots or help needy families (usually with attractive girls in them), and three out of ten steal to give to the poor.</p>								<p class="center">...ooOoo...</p>						</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
