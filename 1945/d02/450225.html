Today I saw tanks loading up with 76mm shells at Taft Avenue so maybe there'll be some action tonight.</p>								<p>I made a short trip to Santo Tomas this morning to deliver some messages and wasn't allowed in for the first time.  I understand a second group of internees has been selected to leave for the States.  Captain Honorato told me about the rescue at Los Baños: "<i>The Japs didn't get a chance to kill anybody there</i>," he said, "<i>we blitzed it with paratroopers, amphibian tanks and regulars</i>."  Well, the Japanese had three weeks to kill anyone there if that was their intention.</p>								<p>Later Maurice and I biked over to meet the Lobregats, noticing the smells still lingered at <i>Vito Cruz</i>.  Much looting was taking place at the Rizal Memorial Stadium.  The Americans can't be everywhere and there's no Philippine Police or Government yet; Osmeña has yet to arrive.</p>								<p>Celso Lobregat and a friend returned to his yard yesterday to retrieve buried valuables.  Peering inside his shelter, he was surprised to see two Orientals.  On the way over, he greeted a Chinese acquaintance on the street so he naturally assumed these were Chinese too.  "<i>Hello?</i>" he called out tentatively.  One of the two stood up and motioned for him to come closer.  Celso and friend took off when they realized the two were Japanese.  By the time they returned with the Yanks, the Japanese had moved to the ruins of their house.  One stepped out into the front steps and was promptly shot.  The other stayed inside, was hunted out and shot too.  I'm beginning to think these so-called Japanese "snipers" are escapees from the Walled City — lost, bewildered and possibly shell-shocked — seeking a more peaceful death or even capture if possible.  But it isn't possible; the Americans shoot first and ask questions later.</p>								<p class="center">. . . .</p>								<p>Raymundo, the missing fourth Heredia brother, showed up today safe and sound.  He used to live in a well-built house in front of the Elena Apartments with his American wife and child.  One night, "<i>at the height of the terror</i>," he related, Japanese soldiers shouted and clanged loudly on his front gate while he and others hid in improvised shelters.  Their decision to not respond proved to be a wise one.  Presuming the house empty, the Japanese moved on to the next house occupied by some Indians — and killed them all.</p>								<p style="text-align: right" class="inLink"><br><a href="450225b.html"> continues...</a></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
