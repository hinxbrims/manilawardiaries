This afternoon Mrs. Garriz said he was dead.  As I was leaving for the Menzis, a jeep went up their shared driveway and swung into the Bernards, disgorging one Captain of the Chemical Intelligence Corps ("<i>W-A-L-S-H; it's Irish</i>") and two others wearing camouflage.  They said they found his body in recently taken territory, executed by the Japanese.  He had a large wound on the head and his neck was half cut-off.</p>								<p>A small crowd gathered at the Bernards: Maurice Klingler; the Mattmans; Campos; Pradera, the Basque Jai-Alai player; and the Bernards.  Everyone was in a jolly mood led by, oh yes, Alfonso Duran, who had had a bit too many.  The animated talk was of Germany, and the Captain threw out a juicy piece of BALONEY about the fighting there as if we didn't know.  The climax however was reached when Duran, fresh off the bottle, pounded the table and roared: "<i>I'll give the Germans 24 hours, no more!</i>"</p>								<p>I worked Walsh around to the fighting on South Manila.  "<i>All I know</i>," he said, "<i>is that there are 500 Japs in Intramuros</i>" — a reasonable figure, I thought.  How about Ermita?  —"<i>Where's that?</i>"</p>								<p>Among other things he said: "<i>We know that one-percent </i>[collaborators]<i> are against us</i>"; the Japanese were using a shell that disperses highly flammable phosphorous gas or liquid; "<i>You're safe enough here </i>[Manga Avenue]<i> to sleep in your beds</i>."</p>								<p>American artillery reached a new high today.  It was a common thing downtown to hear the swish of shells over us — steady firing, not a barrage.  The Americans also used mortars and dive-bombers; the latter over the U.P.  The reply from the Japanese in Intramuros, City Hall, U.P. and perhaps the Legislative Building was limited to machine-guns, rifles and one or two very small cannons.  Artillery firing still shakes our house.  Straightening one of the pictures on the wall, Ma suddenly realized it was a 1920's picture of the newly wed Mencarinis — R.I.P.</p>								<p class ="center">. . . .</p>								<p>Hearing that Bill Dunckel had paid a visit to the Menzis, I went there.  A Colonel here before the war, he's now Major General Dunckel, Marshal Provost General, and he plans to live in Manga Avenue.  A good friend of Margot and her husband Paul Hartnal, he pulled Paul out of Santo Tomas for a quick visit with Margot.  Quite a few people had turned up to meet him but I arrived too late and had to rely on the reports of Maurice, Klingler, Margot and Alfonso Duran.</p>								<p>Duran cornered me and chided me for being with Mrs. Bernard, warning me of "DANGER" as he looked darkly at her.  The General "KNEW" ... and I should be discreet.  "<i>I'm armed, you know?</i>" he said, patting his back pocket, then looked hurt when I didn't react.  "<i>You don't believe me?</i>"  And with that, he reached behind for his weapon — a hip flask of Cherry Brandy.  After a hearty laugh, we got down to business.</p>								<p style="text-align: right" class="inLink"><br><a href="450209c.html"> continues...</a></p>								<p></p>								<p></p>								<blockquote></blockquote>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
