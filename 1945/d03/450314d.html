On the 11th, the Japanese knocked on his gate and he let them in — "<i>a mistake</i>," he said.  Warned by their demeanor, he grabbed the two bags he had prepared for any emergency and marched downstairs.  When he saw the Japanese pouring gasoline on a pile of mattresses and cushions, he rushed back up to get his family.  They fled to a neighbor's house as his caught fire.</p>								<p>The problem was the civilians in that area were aware the Japanese had placed numerous guns inside and between the stadium and the Bay.  Up to the beginning of the battle, the Japanese had succeeded in fooling them: "<i>We heard explosions and thought the Japs had been blowing up things preparatory to leaving but they were actually building bunkers and moving stuff in</i>."</p>								<p>When the Americans began to draw near and the shelling increased, everyone agreed to move to the burnt out house of Manolo Elizalde.  Small groups made several successful trips during lulls in the fighting, including return trips to get food and belongings.  "<i>It was some fire</i>," he said, "<i>I had three cases of imported whiskey and over 50 cases of the local stuff</i>."</p>								<p>The Elizalde compound became a haven for more than 100 refuges sheltering in its dry swimming pool or under trees.  Next door, the Japanese shot and killed several.  Mendez, the owner of a bakery shop before the war across the Quiapo Church, was hit five times but was still alive.  Eventually he was placed inside the Elizalde garage.</p>								<p>The Americans first showed up at 1700, February 12.  The crowd went wild — until the Americans withdrew some 30 minutes later.  Some 7 to 8 Japanese then moved back into the area.  You can imagine how the people there felt by then!  But the Japanese knew the Americans were close by and left them alone.  They did however set fire to three houses before the Americans returned.</p>								<p>The next time the Americans came they were asked to stay around.  "<i>Sorry</i>," went the reply, "<i>we're very few and we've lost quite a lot of men</i>."  Incidentally this is the same thing they said to Elias further up at Baclaran.  At any rate, the Americans evacuated the people to Libertad Street, telling them to leave their clothes behind because the Americans would keep the looters out.  Guerrilleros later entered and helped themselves to some food.</p>								<p></p>								<p class="center">. . . .</p>								<p>Fake guerrilleros have come in for a few words.  To become one in Pasay, one just had to step up to the Americans, say he was a guerrillero and sign a paper to receive a carbine.  I can imagine the tired 11th Airborne Troops thinking they could use the help.  Well, now they would like to have some of those rifles back.</p>								<p style="text-align: right" class="inLink"><a href="450314e.html"><br>continues...</a></p>								<p></p>								<p></p>								<blockquote></blockquote>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
