Guido and his three or four sons were taken to the empty lot in front of Jo-Jo's house and forced to kneel.  The father was beheaded and the boys were shot.  Mortally wounded, one boy of 14 screamed himself to death.  It must have been a shocking episode.</p>								<p class="center">. . . .</p>								<p><b>The Khan Case</b>: Benz and Jo-Jo confirmed the Khans died at the Campos house; both saw the bodies though neither could confirm the death of Pilar Campos.  All they knew was that she was repeatedly raped.  The family of Venezuelan Consul Alberto Delfino also met their death close to the Campos house.  Benz salvaged the official signboard from the ruins in front of the Tinio house.</p>								<p>Following the incident with Pierre Khan's broken glass, the Japanese subsequently returned and found a P-38 model plane built by Jo-Jo for Pierre.  After scrutinizing the plane, the Japanese asked the kid: "<i>Where did you get the plans for this plane?</i>"</p>								<p>The kid was equal to the occasion: "<em>The Mainichi</em>."</p>								<p>"<i>Hmm</i>," mused the Japanese, "<i>I read the Mainichi but I don't remember any such thing.  And this?</i>" he asked next, spotting a Grumman with modern American markings.</p>								<p>"<em>The plane flew low — I saw the markings</em>."</p>								<p>An examination of the dates of his airplane magazine collection showed they were all pre-war, so the search moved elsewhere.  When the officer discovered three disassembled bicycles, which showed a definite attempt to disregard a Japanese order, he stormed off in anger.  The next day the Khans were ousted and later the house was blown up.</p>								<p>On the day of the ousting, Jo-Jo went to see the Khans and was surprised to find a Japanese guard posted there.  Mrs. Khan whispered to him: "<i>Go home Joe.  Burn all your planes and leave no traces as the Japs found here</i>" — which he promptly did.  The other Khan boy was Gilbert, about 16, and then there was a little girl of only 2-1/2 or so years old named Denise.  Oh yes, the Japanese also found a gas model 6-foot airplane and all but accused the kid of being a spy.</p>								<p></p>												<p class="center">. . . .</p>								<p style="text-align: right" class="inLink"><a href="450314c.html"><br>continues...</a></p>								<p></p>								<p></p>								<blockquote></blockquote>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
