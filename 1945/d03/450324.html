No Japanese plane reached the city, but about 28 of them visited the outskirts — Clark Field for one.</p>								<p>At Dasmariñas today I saw 100 Japanese POWs.  They looked like American POWs except that they were slouching — they almost seemed to creep.  As they passed, Filipinos began to spit and hurl epithets at them.</p>								<p>Try getting the MFP now that it's free.  I almost missed mine.  You were sure of getting it when it cost five centavos.  There were none in España today, and I saw a crowd chase one vendor before he got away.</p>								<p>MFP: "Road Traffic Ordered to Move to Right....  Rule goes into effect on April 1st" — reversing the tradition since Spanish times.  Streetcars will also be eliminated. </p>								<p>Page 1: "U.S. Congress to get proof of Japanese cruelty in Manila battle."  Romulo (in Washington) will "shortly present to Congress documentary and photographic proof of wanton Japanese cruelty to helpless citizens."  Joaquin Gillan told Romulo "that the Japs poured kerosene over more than 1,000 Filipino men and turned them into living torches."  (Yes, in Fort Santiago.)</p>								<p>PLN: "Roxas, Paredes, Yulo ALIVE....  Expected to arrive in Manila soon."  No details on rescue or escape.  <i>Voz de Manila</i> previously reported they were already here.</p>								<p>I was disappointed with Romulo's broadcast.  I thought he was going to present "captured documentary proof" that the Japanese received orders to kill every civilian.  I recall Carlos Barreto told me the Japanese got those orders on the 12th while Jo-Jo said it was the 10th.  I doubt if such an order was ever given unless it pertained to prisoners.  If Tokyo gave any orders, it was the same as in 1941 on the subject of the Open City, to wit: "We shall take every measure deemed necessary for the success of our troops and plans."</p>								<p class="center">. . . .</p>								<p style="text-align: right" class="inLink"><br><a href="450324b.html"> continues...</a></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
