When Quezon was there, he cut a figure, talked big, got more than the necessary attention, and usually got what he wanted by backing Uncle Sam into the wall.  Osmeña, on the other hand, is as quiet as a sleeping church mouse.  At least Romulo gets some attention.  Meanwhile our government here is: (a) short-handed; (b) inexperienced; (c) overworked; (d) facing enormous problems; (e) trying to do everything at the same time.  If that isn't enough, Confesor is playing politics; weeding out the Quezon men on the excuse that they were the "cooperators of the Japanese Occupation."  In these critical times we need the best hands we can get on the job.  It's the old hangover of Spanish culture: The Spaniards never forgive, and the Filipinos, instead of following the example of General Grant, are following AMOR-PROPIO.</p>								<p>Romiro got into a fight with Dr. Jose A. Villegas and one of Mueller's MPs.  Villegas is a Health Inspector, which, I am now convinced, means that all those who are not pure Filipino get an OFF LIMITS tag, no matter what.  Romiro was planning to open a café and Villegas wanted to put two "Off Limits" signs because of the grass floor.</p>								<p>"<i>Are you a Filipino?</i>" inquired Villegas.</p>								<p>"<em>Yes</em>," answered Romiro's brother.</p>								<p>"<i>Are you pure?</i>" meaning pure Filipino.  Wrong question.  When the MP started puffing his chest, I butted in and pointed out that the Manila Hotel had tables on its lawn, as did every carnival.  The MP backed down, as they usually do when someone stands up to them.</p>								<p class="center">...ooOoo...</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
