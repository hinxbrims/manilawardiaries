Col. Munfors, a white-haired Filipino USAFFE Major at Bataan, has been an off and on again guerrillero ever since.  Imprisoned in Cebu, the Japanese subjected him to the hanging by handkerchief treatment for a few days while beating a careful but effective tattoo on his Adam's apple.  In touch with Colonel Fertig there, he kept careful records of all collaborators, came to Luzon and landed in Muntinglupa.  He was one of the 114 that escaped in the second breakout from there.  "<i>It was an inside job — fixed with the guards</i>."  Guerrilleros met them at a prearranged spot to help them get away.  After a break from helping the 11th Airborne Division, he went to Manila to give a full accounting of his experiences and name a few spies.  Maurice asked him about Hans Menzi.</p>								<p class="dialogA">— Never heard of him.</p>								<p class="dialogB">— Hans said he recently saved Muntinglupa.</p>								<p class="dialogA">— You tell me where this guy is.  I will tell him he is a liar to his face.</p>								<p>I thought 'Chito' Calvo was gone but he's now Sports Coordinator for LUBSEC<sup>†</sup>.  He was released in December after 45 days in Fort Santiago.  He wasn't a guerrillero but had to admit to being a naughty boy &mdash; to give the Japanese some face.  He got the kneeling treatment.  The guards were mostly OK, many being Korean.  Sometimes you gave them an address and money, and if you were lucky, you got food.</p>												<p class="footnote"><sup>† </sup>Luzon Base Section &mdash; part of ASCOM (Army Service Command)</p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
