It is taken for granted that US Army goods in the possession of civilians are stolen."  I wish he'd go after the looters instead.</p>								<p>So, 41 days since the Americans entered Manila, all those who fantasized about life under freedom have been dealt a cold dose of reality.  Everyone wants to go to the States.  Those who used to work for P2 to P5 a day don't want to work for P1.25 to P1.75.  Those who worked for P1.25 to P1.75 a day don't want to work at all, not while they can collect PCAU rations and still go on the occasional looting spree.  For the middle and upper class, gone is the life of ease: the monthly check from the monopoly factory, the Sunday car parade to show off, the horse races and the life of Reilly.</p>								<p>There's a lack of police, law and order, housing, almost no government, and really no law.  Fortunately there's more and better food, and we're free from the yoke of the Japanese.  We must bear the price of freedom; but it's easier said than done.</p>								<p class="center">. . . .</p>								<p>At the Santo Tomas wards, I stumbled into the long-missing Sandowsky, Mike Mihailoff, a Chicote and one Richter (the latter made a cool million selling machinery to the Japanese).  Chicote's story was the most tragic.  He comes from a family of 9 sisters and 5 brothers, and was in Ermita, San Luis.  He lost his wife, only child of 20 months and five sisters.  His father died just five days ago from wounds suffered during the battle and the shock of hearing about his daughters.</p>								<p>Sandowsky had a harrowing time at Isaac Peral.  With "<i>all of Ermita</i>" burning, he fled to the Ateneo where he lost his wife (his daughter survived) and suffered burns to his feet.  He ended up at the PGH where after another prolonged ordeal he was saved on the 17th.  "<i>Most of the boys here can't sleep at night</i>," he said.  "<i>They take sleeping tablets and still fidget through the night</i>."</p>								<p>Mike Mihailoff almost lost himself only.  Two hours from freedom, an ornery bullet seared one chest and went through the other.  He ended up at the Remedios Hospital where he was almost killed again.  Army doctors might have to pump water out of his right lung.</p>								<p style="text-align: right" class="inLink"><a href="450316b.html"><br>continues...</a></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
