Ditto in the house in front of us where Col. Soriano et al are definitely "in" and definitely "electrified."  Well, I'm using two candles tonight as a special treat.</p>								<p>Conditions in Manila are still bad.  Some are milking the rationing system while others are getting none.  For the most part, people complain about having nothing to do.  Maurice and George had enough of Manila and left for a five-day trip to Lingayen for the hell of it.
