They followed the Americans into an area by car â€” on "<i>armed patrol</i>" with authority to search.  He told me unashamedly that they stopped and stripped people of food, saying: "<i>See Headquarters</i>."</p>								<p>"<i>Let me see your bag</i>," he barked once to a civilian who refused to be intimidated.  The stuff inside was his and that was that.</p>								<p>"<i>Open it up</i>," insisted our guerrillero, "<i>I only want the toothbrush</i>."</p>								<p>"<em>Nope.  Who the hell do you think you are?</em>"</p>								<p>"<i>I'm a guerrillero</i>," shrieked our man.</p>								<p>"<em>Well, so am I!</em>" screamed the civilian.  "<em>And probably with a rank five times higher than yours</em>."</p>								<p>The guerrillero looked him in the eye then relented: "<i>OK, pass</i>."</p>								<p>As for the Japanese, you have no idea how strange they can be.  On the 11th of February, one went to Jo-Jo's house asking for a wristwatch.  Joe dashed into the kitchen and dumped his watch into a rice bag while his aunt and another yielded theirs.  A rendezvous with death around the corner and still grabbing and stealing watches!  But there's a better one yet: Four Japanese grabbed and began taking a girl away.  In the nick of time, Poppa thought up a fast one.  Puffing after them, he offered a nifty watch that pleased the Japanese no end.  Fair trade; the gal was saved.</p>								<p class="center">...ooOoo...</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
