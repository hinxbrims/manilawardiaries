Driving a few looters away, I entered and found that one of the most valuable private Philippine libraries had been wrecked.  Piles of belongings, mementos and clothes were strewn haphazardly in the middle of the rooms.  I spent a sweaty morning tidying things up, stacking what was left neatly for collection, picking up broken family photographs, torn letters, a book here and there....  The looters hadn't even left a chair for me to sit on.</p>								<p>Except for an unnerving burst of machine gun fire, the area was quiet.  A few Americans kept looters at bay for the most part, but their scouts were around, ready to pounce at the first opportunity.  Feeling like a sentry in no-man's-land, I toured the house.  An American shell had hit one of the bedrooms, making a six-foot hole in the roof and spraying every room with shrapnel.  Betty had died there.  George discovered her several days ago and buried her.  A lingering smell of death remained in some rooms.  Outside, the streets around Malate were still strewn with partly burned Japanese corpses.</p>								<p>I had a chat with a couple of 37th Division boys who came in looking for a spot to work on their bottle of whiskey.  Except for a 29-mile ride from San Fernando, they walked all the way from Lingayen, arriving in Bilibid at 0900.  The Japanese sentries had locked-up and left earlier that day.</p>								<p>With no sign of Joe Connor by 1300, I went to the Syquia Apartments to talk to a Lt. Warren (145th Division, I believe).  He agreed to post a guard at the Connors' until 1630.  "<i>Be sure to bring a pass from Col. Mueller, otherwise I can't let you take anything out</i>."  I went to Santo Tomas and found Joe stymied by red tape from the CIC, MPs and Santo Tomas.  He was having trouble getting a pass to protect what was left of his valuables from looters who got around without passes.</p>								<p class="center">. . . .</p>								<p>An American Colonel and an intelligence officer came by this morning to ask if we would rent our house out.  Ma was polite but firm: We were willing to share if necessary.  The Colonel was equally polite: "<i>The house, was meant for a madam, and naturally, she would need the WHOLE house.  But don't you worry, Madam ... and thank you very much</i>," he said, bowing his way out.  Quite a difference from the Japanese.  MacArthur is the only one we'd give this house to, and maybe Sutherland or Krueger who are simpatico, but not Dunckel.</p>								<p>At 1700 I cooled down with a thirty-minute swim in the White House.  Eventually one of eight Americans there asked me: "<i>Are you from General Headquarters?</i>"</p>				<p>"<em>No, I'm your neighbor.  Larry Wiltzius said I could come over</em>."</p>								<p>"<i>Oh ... so long as you know one of the boys</i>."</p>								<p>When the boys went up for chow I went home ... to a house still without electricity or water.</p>								<p class="center">...ooOoo...</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
