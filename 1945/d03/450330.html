The Swiss Consul's report was strictly neutral: 24 Swiss (correct total) now known dead out of something over 200 — mostly in Malate and Ermita.</p>								<p>Emilio Heredia joined us this evening and talked about Nasugbu, quoting his brothers and others.  He said Enrique Santamaria was the most nervous of them all in Nasugbu.  Isabelle, his brother Paul's wife, concurred.

He was in Nasugbu while the <i>Ducks</i>, guerrillas and Americans went and rescued — among others — his wife.  When he suggested to a tough American Colonel of the 11th Airborne that he send some PT boats to Calatagan to rescue his wife, the Zobels and a few others, he got a curt answer: "<i>To hell with your family — we're running a war here!</i>"</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
