On January 6 the Japanese started expediting preparations in that area: "<i>The trucks coming in were bumper-to-bumper ... and often under the watchful eyes of American planes</i>."  At first, the Japanese recruited "voluntary labor from the barrios," but by the end of January the situation had become intolerable.  "<i>The Japs got in the habit of entering any house at will for chow or other necessities</i>."  Matti watched the American planes constantly spying and doing some pretty good spot bombing on the Japanese despite their efforts at camouflage.  </p>								<p>Realizing that the area would explode one day, they returned to Manila on the 24th of January.  The very next day the Americans, apparently acting on the wrong information, began bombing the town itself — "<i>a mistake</i>."  This went on for several days, killing and wounding some 40 to 60 civilians per day, until the whole town was practically evacuated.</p>								<p class = "center">. . . .</p>								<div class="image right" style="width: 150; margin-top: -16px; margin-left: 8px; margin-right: 6px">					<img src="soriano.jpg" border="0" width="150" height="200" alt="soriano">					<div class="caption" style="margin-top: 8px">					Andres Soriano					</div>				</div>				<p>Manga Avenue developments: The Menzi well ran dirty water today, and at 1700 we all had water on tap.  The Siys have rented part of their two-winged house and a couple of houses in their rear to various American Generals, Colonels and Majors.  Col. Soriano, two other colonels and one General will occupy their south wing, where the Japanese Embassy Staff lived.  The Siys will get electricity tonight; the best we'll get is a swim in the General's pool — until MacArthur moves in.  After a half-hour swim today the boys treated me to beers at the Game Room.  One asked me if Soriano (a Spaniard) was French because of his thin mustache.</p>								<p class = "center">...ooOoo...</p>						</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
