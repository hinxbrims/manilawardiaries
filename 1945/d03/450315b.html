It was a telegram "from an unknown base" dated January 31, 1945, and received on February 3, 1945 at 1339 — five hours before the Americans entered the city.</p>								<p class="center">...ooOoo...</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
