So the refugees and wounded remained there for two more days.  A few moved out toward American lines that the Japanese were shelling.  As the American line moved up, the Concordia came under the range of Japanese shells so things were not all well yet.  The third floor had to be evacuated due to the condition of the roof.  Rumors started that the Japanese were up there preparing to blow the place up.  The Americans finally went up to take a look and returned saying that they "<i>removed the bomb</i>" — possibly just to reassure the refugees.</p>								<p>The Japanese started several fires in the building that the refugees had to put out.  She thinks the Japanese or makapilis were coming in amongst the refugees.  With everyone dirty and in tattered clothes, it was hard to tell.  At 0300 on the 11th, fire broke out on the third floor — a curious location unless it was due to a Japanese shell.  "<i>Imagine the terror in the over-crowded place jammed with hysterical men and women, the sick, the dying and even the insane.  The people rushed the doors ... and can you beat it?  All doors were bolted ... locked!</i>"  Fortunately a few guerrillas and American soldiers opened the doors and saved the people.</p>								<p>Relating this to Paul Heredia later, he said: "<i>It's a wonder the Concordia didn't burn earlier.  Roxas and Company </i>[where he used to work] <i>had 1,000 cases of rum and gin there</i>."</p>								<p class="center">. . . .</p>								<p>In the afternoon, with the aid of a 13-year-old Alhambra Ford panel delivery, Mrs. Connor and I went to 106 Militar to get the rest of her belongings — and did we have a tough time!  Major Baldwin and a group of MPs have taken the area over and you can't get in without a pass.  At that I saw nobody in the area except three or four — looters, of course.  Without a pass, we got through two MP lines: the first by ignoring advice to turn back, and the second by sheer pleading.  We said we would make two trips and positively bring a pass from Major Baldwin the second time.  Actually we had tried to see Baldwin but he had been out and time was precious.  So we got in and who busts into 106 Militar but the Major himself — wondering how the hell we had gotten in.</p>								<p>On the way back, we stopped for a drink at the Manila Gas Corporation.  I got a shock when I realized that no one was working there — there's nothing to work with.  MFP today frankly stated that there would be no electricity for "several months."  If the Caliraya and Botocan power plants can be salvaged, we might get some in two months.  At least we had water this morning at home — 25 hours without interruption by noon.</p>								<p class="center">...ooOoo...</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
