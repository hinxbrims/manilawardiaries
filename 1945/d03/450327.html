I wished he had talked about the problems of rehabilitating the nation instead; correspondents have already covered the atrocity stories.</p>								<p>At Santo Tomas, Gene Hotimsky told me he lost his son in Pasay during the Battle of Manila.  He mostly kicked against the guerrilleros: "<i>Five Japanese ruled the road to Pasay and went about with complete impunity.  Two guerrilleros with pistols could've ambushed them easy</i>."  Aye, but with what complications?</p>								<p>Visited Miguel Graemiger this afternoon; Swiss Consul Maurer was there.  "<em>Is it true you lost twenty-one men?</em>" I asked him.</p>								<p>"<i>Twenty-two</i>," he corrected, "<i>of which twenty-two were murdered</i>."</p>								<p>"<em>Massacred, you mean</em>," corrected Graemiger.</p>								<p>Maurer was sure the Japanese put them in a shelter and hurled grenades inside.</p>								<p>Graemiger moaned about the loss of his records on dealing with the Japanese and PRIMCO.  All of his meticulously kept records and notes were burned.</p>								<p class="center">. . . .</p>								<p>Mrs. Graemiger described Arthur MacArthur as "<i>the world's loneliest boy — even at the Manila Hotel prewar</i>."  When the Graemigers were there, the Chinese amah used to plead with her to bring her children along to play with Arthur.  Arthur rarely leaves home nowadays — I've only seen him across the street at the Soriano's once — and Manga Avenue is full of kids his age.</p>								<p>Tonight, MacArthur is entertaining ten MPs (probably chosen at random) at his house.  I spoke to an intelligent MP with a large forehead and thinning blond hair.  Knowing that he had questioned many about Japanese activities in the Philippines, I told him that the Japanese acted decently enough in 1942.  He was astonished even though Maurer had told him the same thing three hours earlier.  "<i>Good Gosh!</i>" said he.  "<i>That's the opposite of what everyone's been telling me</i>."  He thought the Japanese had come in looting and kept it up for three years.</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
