I asked Father Cosgrave if more than a hundred could have been there.  "<i>Oh, I hardly think that many</i>," he answered promptly, "<i>less than that</i>."  He did say that some of the La Salle Brothers thought they saw Tony being marched across to the Nippon Club (La Salle is between both locations) — they had been warned not to look out the windows.</p>								<p>Little by little it all comes out in the wash.  This doesn't excuse the Japanese, of course, but indicates that atrocities were not a general policy.  Nevertheless, the La Salle case and the Walled City case, where the Japanese put 600 men to death, are inexplicable beastly acts that I'd like to check further.</p>								<p class="center">. . . .</p>								<p>There were two big explosions today.  The first was near the City Hall while I was having lunch at Santo Tomas — probably the biggest explosion I've heard so far — shot up a dirty column of smoke into the air.  A GI told me it covered the ground around with two feet of dust and debris.  At 1700 another large explosion came from the direction of Camp Murphy.</p>								<p>At Tondo I saw many hundreds of ration boxes ready for distribution.  When Maurice returned from San Fabian recently, he said he saw thousands of such boxes there.  A couple of days ago, the boys at the White House Game Room complained about a shortage of rations.  "<i>There just ain't any second helpings</i>," said one to two nodding GIs.  I wasn't surprised because the tall blond fellow with glasses and crusted hair was still sneaking whole boxes of rations out of the White House via our yard.</p>								<p>There is, of course, a great shortage of liquor, and some of the men would barter their souls for a bottle — and do.  One officer lamented: "<i>From factory to ship, ship to amphibian, amphibian to shore, shore to truck, truck to depot, depot to soldiers — at each step some of the stuff goes the way of all flesh.  And it's all charged to SHIPPING LOSSES</i>."</p>								<p>People in Manila are having trouble getting work.  Army depots usually have a sign saying, "No civilian aid needed."  Those having some success at getting placed are those who "give" or "entertain" — that is, they made some money during the occupation.  "<i>No doubt</i>," sighed one today, "<i>the US Army will eventually get around to tracking these collaborators, but if they don't hurry up they'll find 'em all holding important military or civilian posts</i>."</p>								<p class="center">...ooOoo...</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
