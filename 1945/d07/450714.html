The car stopped and a husky guy leaned out to ask: "<i>Going my way?</i>"</p>								<p>Getting in, the husky fellow surprised Sotelo by saying, "<i>I'm Admiral Halsey</i>."  They got along fine as Sotelo said he was from Iloilo and Halsey had been there.  Halsey dropped him right in front of his house.

George Schultze got out on a one-day pass, and dropped in to ask me to see someone in CIC about getting his dad and brother out.  His dad came from Germany 35 years ago, married a Spanish lady and never went back.  I saw George a lot during the occupation and confided to him that I was listening to the radio.  Turned out that George was listening too â€” with the Garriz boys.  He wanted to join the guerrillas in Legaspi but his dad didn't allow it because he was the family's main breadwinner.</p>								<p>George likes his work with the supply detail, as he gets to go out with the truck every day.  Says 2,300 loaves of bread go to the internees and Japanese prisoners; the latter total 10,900 at Muntinglupa.  I asked him how the Japanese prisoners were acting.  "<i>They cringe and whistle all over the place, and bow and yes-sir you to death.  You never saw anything more humble in your life</i>."</p>								<p class="center">. . . .</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
