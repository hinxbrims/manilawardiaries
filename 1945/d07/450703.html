The American planes were parked wing-to-wing as the danger of any Japanese raid had long passed.  This plane came out of nowhere — probably had been undergoing repairs — and was responsible for 87 American deaths.  He didn't confirm about the 12 planes destroyed, including a C-54.  "<i>Biak was a tough nut to crack</i>," he added.  "<i>The day MacArthur announced that all organized Japanese resistance had ended, the Japs killed 900 Americans!</i>"  His tale of units trapped between ridges was similar to what the Japanese told us.  That the Japanese sent a fleet to attack Mindoro was another <i>tall tale</i> we didn't believe until Hans mentioned the damage they caused.</p>								<p>MacArthur is back next door.
