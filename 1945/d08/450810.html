Local scandals take back seat for the time being.</p>				<p><b>Flash</b>: Japan Offers Surrender!  The news caught Manila unaware, but impromptu celebrations began soon after.  For a while I thought there was a fight going on near here, and so did the MacArthur guards, especially Major Richards, despite the fact he must have known the news clearly hinted the end was in sight.</p>								<p>Last night, two bullets whizzed by: one hit the tree between MacArthur's house and ours, and the other bounced on the sidewalk near a guard.  Captain Richards, who has never been under combat, went into a tantrum of nervousness that sent his combat-worthy guards into hysterics.  He called the Motor Pool asking for all available jeeps.  "<i>They're shooting at MacArthur's house</i>," he yelled into the phone.  At any rate, Richard's next act was to wake up the entire Company, and send them to their posts.  Eight were in our yard; the four I chatted with were amused.</p>								<p>The sound came from all over Santa Mesa: considerable shouts of celebration.  Then, from farther down the city, the Church bells began to peal while whistles and horns joined in and the shouting and noise rose sensationally.  Lastly, Padre Gil started ringing his bells.  I dressed to take a look-see by way of the Siys, who have electricity and their radio tuned in to San Francisco.  It was repeating Domei's announcements on the Japanese offer to accept the terms of the Potsdam surrender conditions, with one qualification about the Emperor.  On to the Sotelos and a little beer courtesy of Manhattan College Professor Featherstone to celebrate the birthday of the old man.  I returned at midnight, about the time Richards relaxed the guards.  An honor guard in our garden told me the General was a riot.  He hugged and squeezed Jean in the garden following receipt of the news.</p>								<p class="center">. . . .</p>							<span class="date">August 13, 1945</span>							<p>Manila Chronicle: Japan in crisis as "Big Four" await reply....
