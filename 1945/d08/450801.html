You can debate about the degree of each one's worthiness, but the overall effect was massive.  I'm thinking of classifying them from top to bottom: active and inactive; from guys who didn't pay their streetcar fares to our <i>paratroopers</i> — those who persisted in jumping off the streetcars before they came to a stop.  We could start from there and build up to the best status for an inactive guerrilla, or those who were keeping a diary or listening to short-wave radios.  Some people even seemed to have better information, at times even ahead of the Joint Staffs in Washington.  In the matter of strategists, we doubtless had the best in the world.  I'm one of them.  Without them we might have lost the war.  I'm kidding, of course.</p>				<p class="center">. . . .</p>							<span class="date">August 6, 1945</span>							<p>Not much news and I missed all the papers.

One of the guards then told me.
