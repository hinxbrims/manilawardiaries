He was taken with Elizalde, Pirovano, Menzi, Santamaria, et al at their party.  Santamaria was held for six days, Hans for a couple of weeks, and Corominas for four months.  Corominas suffered several beatings but was released because he refused to admit anything and wasn't guilty.  Out of 24 involved, only three are alive: himself, Hans and Manolo Elizalde.  They had been charged with aiding guerrillas with money, espionage, propaganda, and having a transmitter.  Grupe<sup>†</sup> operated the transmitter and paid for it with his life.  The Japanese sent 3,500 troops to Mindoro and "got" the transmitter they were in contact with there.  Their primary objective was to arrange an escape by Roxas to Australia via submarine.  Corominas said Roxas is alive because those who died, including Ozamiz, kept their mouths shut to the end.</p>								<p>Osmeña asked him if he had received any recognition for his part in the affair.  Corominas said no — probably because he belonged to a different group to Parson's mob.  He blamed the latter for the loss of his mother-in-law, Blanche Walker Jurika, who was involved in the pamphlet operation.</p>				<p class="center">. . . .</p>							<span class="date">June 17, 1945</span>							<p>Post: "Congressional Wreckord" — politicians are in uproar because the ECA distributed 1,385,000 rations and the census shows only 843,901 people are here.</p>								<p>Of Americans captured in the Philippines, 92% are dead or slaving in Japanese prison camps.
