Osmeña said that the sufferings and tragedies of the Filipinos were due to their loyalty to the States.  He was less successful explaining what the Commonwealth Government did in the States during the occupation (not much), and dwelt too long on the subject of independence.  Roxas gave a very politically correct speech and skipped the subject of independence:</p>								<blockquote>Only those who remained in the Philippines and have seen and shared the sufferings and brutalities inflicted upon the masses of our population can testify to the valor and patriotism and loyalty of the men, women and children of the Philippines</blockquote>								<p>Meanwhile, The Chronicle named those appointing family members to government jobs: Confesor, Dr. Reyes, Cabahug, Jaranilla, Kalaw, Valdes, Cabili, Rodriguez, Cañizares and others, including President Osmeña himself!</p>								<p>The purchasing power of the peso is now down to P0.16 from around P0.40 in August of 1943.  Maurice, just back from a trip to Cabanatuan, said the quantity of army stuff being peddled-around up north is simply terrific.  Even sentries are stooping to a bit of looting.  They stop you not on the road but away from it so that any irregularities can be settled by pilfering.</p>								<p class="center">. . . .</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
