Sugiyama "for interview," where they'll be coerced to join the Constabulary or go back to prison hell.  Some recruits don't realize they could be sent to the outlying areas to fight guerrillas and the USAFFE.</p>								<p>With a wife and seven children, it's a tough choice for West-Pointer Major Gomez.  He'll "serve" to stay out of a disease-infested prison camp, but with considerable misgivings.  Fidel Segundo and Capinpin are West Pointers already serving in a high rank.  Arming these guys can only backfire on the Japanese.</p>				<p>One West Pointer hasn't joined though — General Lim.  Released to a hospital, Lim gave his doctors carte blanche to administer him any suitable injection prior to Japanese visits — even if it kills him — so long as he doesn't qualify to join the constabulary.</p>				<p>Officer Valeriano's father, taken prisoner in Cebu, was forced to go to Iloilo at the vanguard of a Japanese landing party.  The Japanese had been using his name to ask the USAFFE to surrender.  Upon landing, a USAFFE sergeant shot him forthwith as a traitor.  His son lives only to vindicate the honor of his father, a USAFFE loyalist to the end.</p>				<p>At Santo Tomas, a surprise inspection of returning laundry bags uncovered booze and 220 notes — some with forbidden radio news!  It'll be Fort Santiago for some, and the rest will have to sober up.  You can't send even a pickle today.</p>				<p></p>				<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
