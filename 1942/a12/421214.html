They move on to the house of retired Constabulary Col. Paz, thence to Dr. Abad's house, where the soldiers disembark.  The men tramp all over the garden and finally spot their target — a dwarf-sized Japanese tree used on their altars.  They begin to dig it out just as Dr. Abad, a Japanese-trained doctor fluent in the language, appears.  An officer politely explains they need the tree and hopes he won't mind.  Hurt, the doctor says OK, but points to the damage inflicted on his fence.  The officer promises to send two bags of cement to help repair it as they leave with their prize.  The good doctor is still hurt and puzzled.  They didn't have to break down his fence and tramp all over his garden.  "They could have asked first."</p>				<p class="center"><br>. . . .<br><br></p>								<p>The Shell-Craft Tea Room opposite our store used to have a sign: "We serve only American coffee, with cream and refined sugar."  One day, a Domei man rushed in and yelled at the manager: "Take that sign out and destroy it — right now!  We don't want any American signs up."  He didn't leave until the deed was done.  Hearing about it, Schaer's menu now looks like this: American Lemonade, American Orangeade....</p>				<p class="center"><br>...ooOoo...<br><br></p>				<p>The Japanese mapmaker has been talking to Schaer again.</p>								<p class="dialogB">"Which victory do you think, is the greatest we've won?" he asked.</p>				<p class="dialogA">"Your sinking the Prince of Wales and Repulse in one day," answered Schaer.  "In my opinion you should be more proud of that than Pearl Harbor."</p>				<p class="dialogB">The mapmaker thought it over and agreed.  A moment later, he added, "You know — for us Japanese it is do or die.  If America loses, it can still be a great nation.  With us, we either rise or we are lost forever."  He paused, deep in thought.  "You know ... America ... very big production," he said, twitching off a shrug.</p>				</td>							</tr>		</table>	</div>	<div class="footer2">		<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="710" align="left">			<tr align="center">				<td align="center" valign="top" width="55">					&nbsp;				</td>				<td align="center" valign="top" width="200">					&nbsp;				</td>				<td align="center" valign="top" width="246">				<br><span class="inLink"><a href="#p1">- Top -</a></span>				</td>								<td align="center" valign="top" width="209">					&nbsp;				</td>			</tr>		</table>	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
