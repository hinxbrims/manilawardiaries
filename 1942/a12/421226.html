It should have been a 20-minute film but the Japanese padded it with excessive anti-American propaganda.  Done with the typical heavy-handedness of the propaganda people, it was so vile that it succeeded in doing the complete opposite!  The Americans were portrayed as the underdogs: beaten, yes; kicked out, yes; humiliated, yes; disgraced ... NO!  After living with the Americans for 44 years, the Filipinos can make their own judgement, so why insult their intelligence?</p>								<p>I was not a biased man at the show today; having been told the worst about the film, I sat well back, determined to judge its propaganda value impartially.  Not only was it a complete failure, it was almost a crime.  As Carlos Barreto suggested, I strained my ears at the last three-second shot of a fluttering Japanese flag ... and heard not a single clap from the mostly Filipino audience — not even from the 150 or so Japanese in attendance.  You could've heard a pin drop.</p>				<p class="center">. . . .<br><br></p>				<p>Benny Gaberman, riding in a carromata downtown near Pureza, passed by ten Japanese officers waiting for the bus.  One of them hailed Benny's driver with an imperative, "Hmm!"</p>				<p class=dialogB>The cochero pointed to Benny, shook his head and answered, "Hmm!"</p>				<p>Even louder, the officer said, "Hmm!"</p>				<p class=dialogB>But the cochero only shook his head again and said, "Hmm!"</p>								<p>"Gosh," said Benny, "I looked straight ahead and waited for the fireworks.  The Jap officer again said, 'Hummp!' real loud but the cochero replied, <i>'Hummp!'</i> just as loudly.  I was scared stiff, but to my amazement the cochero got away unscathed.  I breathed a big sigh of relief and asked him, 'Say, you took a big chance — why didn't you stop?'  I almost fell off my seat when he answered, <i>'Aww, I don't like the Japanese.'</i>"</p>				<p class="center">...ooOoo...<br><br></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
