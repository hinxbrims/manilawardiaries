A radio announcement tonight asked everyone owning a transmitter, radiotelephone apparatus or any similar devices, including parts, to turn them in.  Selling these items is prohibited — in fact the Japanese will now buy all said items.  The search this morning extended to Elmac's, Red Star's radio department, and all other radio dealers.  The Japanese took notes of stock on hand.  Meanwhile, Manila policemen, probably using addresses from radio licenses, are going house-to-house inspecting and taking notes on radios.  One tried to discourage a friend of mine from using his short-wave set.  "How can I listen to Tokyo, then?" asked my friend.  No answer — it's obvious that no one listens <i>only</i> to Tokyo.</p>								<p>Human nature being what it is, silver coins and jewelry have disappeared during some house searches, so all Manila is now busy hiding valuables.</p>				<p>Rumors are widespread regarding Morato, the mayor of Quezon City and a close friend of Quezon himself.  He must be one of those "leading figures" mentioned in recent days as being hostile to the Japanese.  Some say he was arrested and released; others say he was shot.</p>				<p>Another prominent person arrested was Lily Raquiza.  When the port area was opened to the public, she was apparently ready with several hired trucks and a borrowed army truck, and loaded up big time.  The loot turned up in a search and she had to do some fast explaining.  It wasn't fast enough to avoid being sent to Fort Santiago.</p>				<p></p>				<p></p>				<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
