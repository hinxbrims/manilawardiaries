Biked around the Boulevard six times in the afternoon but saw little.</p>								<p>The Tribune announced that Manila would be totally blacked-out during raids; at other times we should use "limited illumination."  We've also been ordered to list our radios and remove all rooftop antennae at once.  Ordinary wire antennae are allowed.  Violators "will be severely punished."  The idea is to impede us from getting foreign news.  Typical comment here is: "What are they afraid of, the truth?"</p>				<p>Signs of co-prosperity: The Japanese are taking all of San Miguel's beer and soda output.  Company truck drivers who used to get P150 a month before commissions are now getting P20, and one bigshot has gone from P600 to P60.  Manila rents are dropping fast and even utilities are not fussing about outstanding bills.  A former client with nine houses rented-out lost five tenants to Santo Tomas, three to the countryside, and his one remaining tenant is broke.  So far I haven't heard of any evictions.  Only restaurants are doing well at higher prices â€” while they can still buy food.</p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
