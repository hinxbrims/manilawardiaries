News is the Japanese landed in Bali and a naval battle is on in NEI waters.  According to the Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan can now wage war for even 100 years.</p>								<p>This morning, a shy Japanese sentry asked me politely to remove my hat, refusing to believe I was Filipino.  He seemed relieved when I explained I was French-Filipino.  Everyone in town is swapping anecdotes of the occupation.  During the night raid of January 26, a Christian Brother at La Salle reported the Japanese stationed there ran from the building screaming "blackout" at the top of their lungs.  There's talk about the execution of Manchukuo Chinese deserters in Manila.  One fellow saw two sobbing Japanese tied up in the Port Area after getting a beating.  At 1400 in Plaza Goiti, one intrepid Filipino grabbed the rifle of a sentry and tossed it in the river as he fled.  The most ominous report says the Japanese are intercepting rice shipments into Manila.</p>				<p>The Red Star store is doing good business with its two trucks bringing vegetables from Baguio for resale here at 100 to 200% profit.  The trucks also manage to squeeze-in four passengers at P35 each, more than paying for the costs of the trip.  Being a German firm, they have no trouble getting passes.</p>				<p>Anxious to restart base-metal mines, a Japanese mining official called a meeting of the Chamber of Mines.  Paul Meyer Sr., President of Baguio Gold and Mindanao Mother Lode, asked about his mines but the Japanese weren't interested in gold.  As for Mindanao he was told, "We haven't occupied that territory yet.  We're only in Davao."</p>				<p></p>				<p></p>				<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
