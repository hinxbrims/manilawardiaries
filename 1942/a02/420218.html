He goes on to disclaim Japanese imperialism, pointing out "actual" deeds in Manchukuo (Japanese occupied Manchuria), Indo-China, Thailand and other countries (skipping Korea).</p>								<blockquote>But if you fail to understand the true and lofty purpose of Japan and instead obstruct the successful prosecution of the military activities and tactics of the Imperial Japanese forces, whoever you are, we shall come and crush you with our might and power, and thus compel you to realize by means of force the true significance and meaning of our mission in the Far East.</blockquote>				<p>Meanwhile, the army has stated that one of its educational aims is to replace English with Japanese (not Tagalog) in due course â€” the logic presumably being that it's an Asian language.  The big "Asia for Asiatics" campaign included the dropping of leaflets over Bataan and Corregidor saying that 300 Filipino tunnelers in Corregidor were murdered to keep their work secret!  Filipinos were only amused.  Corregidor defenses were secretly built by groups of workers who were rotated out (including some from Hawaii) so not one could get a good overall picture of the works.</p>				<p>Business remains at a standstill.  Sales at the store averaged just P20 in the last 4 days.  We made one sale today, and the lady admitted she wouldn't have bought the two dresses if she hadn't needed them.  Her family's house in Malolos was looted clean after they moved to Manila to escape the advancing Japanese.  Many others fled and have still to return from the mountains.  Their lack of faith, entirely justified, irks the Japanese.  Stories travel quickly in this country.  Like the one of the girl whose salary went from P60 to P19 a month.  When she complained that transportation would eat up 40% of her salary, her Japanese employer said: "Why don't you buy a bicycle, or walk?"</p>				<p>Lolita stood in line for six hours to get her residence certificate today.  The public outcry reached such a level that the Japanese announced that they would open four other issuing branches.</p>				<p></p>				<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
