A friend I met at 1730 said he stood in line all day and hadn’t eaten anything yet.</p>				<p>The Japanese are telling merchants to limit profits to 35% of sales or risk absolute confiscation of their goods.  It’s barely enough to remain in business even in peacetime.

Over 25 prominent Chinese merchants were released today but a few of the most prominent ones are still locked up.  Theaters will be allowed to open again tomorrow but they’ll have to give the conquerors 30% of the proceeds.</p>				<p>VoF said MacArthur is mopping up Japanese units on Bataan’s left flank.
