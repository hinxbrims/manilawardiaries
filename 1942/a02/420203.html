Meanwhile, Corregidor has shelled areas in Ternate, Cavite, targeting invasion barges destined for Bataan.  La Vanguardia announced the start of a general offensive on the Mariveles sector of Bataan, calling it "the final attack."</p>								<p>The Japanese are advocating a return to spiritualism: <i>"A nation that indulges in pretty dresses, nice food, physical enjoyment and expensive fashion can never succeed."</i>  Well, with business stopped and almost no real money circulating, spiritualism is all that's left.  The Japanese are also declaring war on profiteers.  They'll cut out the middlemen and insert exclusive Japanese agents then arrest the retailer if his price is too high — co-prosperity indeed!  Three Philippine banks finally opened today: PNB, BPI and PBC — paying in real currency up to the P500 limit.</p>				<p>An old-timer tonight reminisced about the American occupation of 40 years ago.  The Americans took nothing and even overpaid cheerfully with gold dollars.  When they passed by house windows flung open and girls quietly cast winks and smiles at 'em.  "At 6:00 o'clock this afternoon," said this Filipino, "all the girls will be behind locked doors, and if a Jap battalion passes, the windows will be locked shut."</p>				<p>Well, they won't be passing by tonight.  A large number of troops have left the city taking along their supplies and equipment.  I found the streets deserted when I went for a walk at 2130.</p>				<p></p>				<p></p>				<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
