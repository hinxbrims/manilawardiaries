He gets a pass for 2 to 3 days, after which he has apply for a renewal which takes a lot of time.  Earlier, he was engaged by a Filipino lumber company to collect a P4,000 bill from the Japanese.  After much effort he succeeded in getting a payment order â€” only one of four granted out of 170 such petitions.</p>								<p>The document told him to go to a certain place for payment.  After getting the run-around a few times he finally located and entered the unimpressive house.  Inside, 8 or 9 tough-looking officers regarded him with hostility and showed every sign of considering his intrusion an affront.  They examined his claim, complained about the amount, and threatened him a number of times.  Sent to wait alone in a little room, Quijano started wondering if they'd bump him off and claim the payment.  How could he escape?  After 15 minutes, he was informed the matter would have to undergo investigation.  If it was another division that bought the goods, he would have to seek payment directly from them.  Juan took his papers and fled, feeling pure joy with his first breath of outside air.  The order is still unpaid; one of 4 "successful" payment petitions out of 170.</p>								<p>Juan confirmed Corregidor had been shelling Ternate (he was sleeping in the next barrio).  On his return from work the next evening the townspeople told him four truckloads of Japanese corpses had been fished out of the sea.</p>				<p>A Tabacalera rep' just back from Tarlac said the Japanese were sending their casualties from Bataan to the north, and were looking for houses there to convert into hospitals.</p>				<p></p>				<p></p>				<p></p>				<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
