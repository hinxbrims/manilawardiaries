Canned sugar-peas, homegrown lettuce, spinach and fried chicken for the only dish, then a chocolate cake as only Ma can make 'em — two layers with apricot jam in between topped with pure chocolate icing!  And for the <i>finale</i>, a homemade vanilla ice cream that was magnificent.  Only in the midst of it, Ma had to start thinking of Joe as she often does.

Another article is on a complaint by one Mamoru Shinozaki, of the Japanese Consulate, on conditions during his internment: the room was small; the food bad.  Well, compared to those who spent time at Villamor Hall, he had three times more space and a million times more food.</p>				<p></p>				<p></p>				<p></p>				<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
