A few more of these and the traffic will stop completely.</p>								<p>For spite, the family of General Basilio Valdes was kicked out of their home and not allowed to take any belongings.  The Tuasons were raided today by tough soldiers who almost tore their house apart because they failed to declare all stocks in their distillery.  As a result, everyone is being extra cautious.  It's got me thinking of where we could end up if the Japanese find out about Joe or my writings.</p>				<p>The sweetest and costliest air raid shelter belongs to Cacho.  As exports of sugar stopped, its price dropped to almost zero — certainly cheaper than sand and sacks — so he used 200 of his 1,800 sacks of sugar to build his shelter.  Later, the Japanese sealed his stocks in a Tabacalera bodega and set a price of P10 a sack.  As he says, "How was I to know?"</p>				<p>Sometimes, the army yields concessions to the locals, which are ignored when the navy steps in.  Dy Nuncio was able to get an army pass to salvage his tremendous bodegas.  Then the Japanese navy stepped in and, to hell with the army, took almost everything.</p>				<p>The following fictitious conversation between four guys will give you an idea of how some people talk these days:</p>				<p class="dialogB">— Boy, I hear the waters around Cebu are heavily mined.</p>				<p class="dialogA">— Yes — and the port is being heavily fortified.</p>				<p class="dialogB">— Airbases are mushrooming all over the front there.</p>				<p class="dialogA">— I hear they've received some planes.</p>				<p class="dialogB">— Some planes?  Hell, there are 100 bombers there right now!</p>				<p class="dialogA">— And tanks too.</p>				<p class="dialogB">— Planes, tanks, and men — that's right, I hear they even had a parade there.</p>				<p>Then they become aware of the absurdity of the conversation and burst out laughing.</p>				<p>At 1330, I was surprised to see hundreds of soldiers standing 50 feet apart on both sides of <a href="../../_maps/escolta.html">Carriedo</a>, Plaza Goiti, and well up Avenida Rizal.  I biked right through and no one paid me the slightest attention.</p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
