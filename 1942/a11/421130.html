The truth is self-evident in view of the fact that the recent American fleet which ran the gauntlet of the Japanese forces consisted of newly built ships."</p>								<p>Sencio, who's been with my Dad for 20 years, unburdened himself today.  His son was studying Japanese and reached the advanced class.  The Japanese took 25 of the best students to the Port Area, where they will stay for special lessons until the course is completed.  They get one peso a day and are allowed to go home one day a week.  The training consists of exercises in the morning, classes in the afternoon, and a lecture.  They've had two weeks of lectures, all with the same theme: "You are Orientals, live like one, be one, be faithful to your race."  Sencio is worried they might be sent to the Visayas.  The boys there joke about their position, they figure they will end up in chains â€” preferably American rather than Japanese, they say.</p>				<p></p>				<p></p>				<p></p>				<p></p>				<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
