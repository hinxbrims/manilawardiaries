Axis offers its strongest resistance to the British attack."  According to the BBC, Berlin, "showing an unexpected sense of humor, has announced that its third line has been stabilized."</p>								<p>I just missed Joe marching up Plaza Goiti by minutes.  He called out to Carlos Young, "I'm Joe Brimo, tell my family I'm all right.  I think we're sailing."  I chased another group and yelled, "Tell Joe Brimo his family is all right."  Several looked back as if to ask, "What?"  They couldn't ask, of course, that would have got me into trouble.  I remembered those marching up from Corregidor; here they were again months later, looking rested but worse.  I saw in their eyes an expression of hurt, a quiet desperation, probably thinking they're off to Japan.  They too wanted to smile or say hello, but didn't dare.  And so they said nothing and went on walking under the hot sunlight, sweating, like the Legion of the Condemned.</p>				<p>What a mood I was in when I got home!  Ma was there with some sheet music resurrected from the Connor's attic â€” songs of my time in the U.S.  I played a song that Joe and I used to sing together.  Me, here at home ... Joe at the pier ... just a handful of Japanese between us, virtually a world apart.</p>				<p>Maurice went up to the pier and got a friend to ask permission from an officer to visit the prisoners.  We were supposed to get an answer by 1800 but the call didn't come.  The prisoners are now under the charge of the tough Japanese Military Police.  In the bay are eight Japanese freighters and two destroyers, ready to take them away.</p>				<p></p>				<p></p>				<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
