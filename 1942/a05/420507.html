By 1100 on the following morning, they had occupied Malinta Hill and the fate of the fortress was sealed.  Domei:</p>								<blockquote>The first landing was followed by a second, third and fourth waves of Japanese forces who set foot on the island fortress at dawn on May 6.  Under a bright moonlight, the Japanese forces in dauntless bayonet charges pressed the enemy defenders to the three sides of Corregidor.				<br><br>				Utilizing suicide tactics ... Japanese units effected landings on Corregidor, beating off counter-attacks by the American-Filipino forces.  The first landings were made on the East Coast of Corregidor Island by units under officers Moye, Maruyama, Karino and Hiramatsu.  There continued a severe midnight attack on the enemy forces, which resisted desperately along a well-constructed defense line.  Early Wednesday morning these units reached the foot of Malinta Hill, which is the foremost fortress in the east half of Corregidor, and at the same time continued frontal attacks on the enemy.  Meantime, the Corregidor defenders launched counter-attacks several times in final efforts to hold the fortress.								<br><br>Early this morning artillery from Carballo and Fraille islands, and artillery in the south side of Corregidor poured shells on the spot where the Japanese units landed, but Japanese artillery and air forces in close cooperation with each other attacked the enemy artillery one after the other.  At the same time they severely bombed and shelled Malinta Hill and other military objectives on the east and west areas of the island.  Fires started all around the islands and black smoke rose high into the sky.  Rings of fire showed the havoc caused on the islands.  Some enemy units again attempted to counter-attack the Japanese forces near Cape Jorges early this morning [May 6].  However, the Japanese forces annihilated all the attackers, and then pressed the attack to the head of the island fortress.</blockquote>				<div class="image right" style="width: 282px; margin-top: 12px; margin-left: 8px; margin-right: 10px">					<img src="malinta_surrender.png" border="0" width="282" height="212" alt="Malinta Tunnel">					<div class="caption">					Malinta Tunnel					</div>				</div>								<p>La Vanguardia: "Wainwright captured with his staff ... Total occupation of Corregidor about to happen ... The Japanese captured the fort using suicide tactics, the first operation of it's kind in history."  Here is the entire translated Domei article:</p>				<blockquote>From a base in Corregidor: Lt. Gen. Jonathan Wainwright, not being able to resist the devastating Japanese attack, offered to personally surrender at 11:00 at night at the foot of Mount Malinta, when the Japanese soldiers that landed were able to surround the General and his staff.</blockquote>				<p>KZRH said that Wainwright would be on the air sometime after 2200 tonight.  "In the meantime, we have a special program of music which we are dedicating to all who still cannot see the light and who have a mistaken conception of loyalty."  We were then served with popular American music just to make sure people would listen.  At 2320 the music was interrupted:</p>				<blockquote>Calling General Sharp and Generals J.P. Horan and Nakar.   This is station KZRH.  Please stand by until 11:30.  Lieutenant General J. Wainwright has an important message for you.</blockquote>				<p style="text-align: right" class="inLink"><br><a href="420507b.html"> continues...</a></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
