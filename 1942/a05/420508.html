Several cars with banners proclaiming the Japanese victory made the rounds of the city.  Accompanying them were a number of trucks with musicians to attract attention.  "Have your flags ready!" said the Tribune, for Homma, who'll arrive in Manila tomorrow between 1200 and 1230 — lunch-hour (people on the streets).  The Mayor <em>asked</em> the people to line up at Avenida Rizal.</p>								<p>A few are nervous or even scared, but not the cochero who was taken to task by a friend of mine for flying a small flag on the harness of his horse.  Asked if he was pro-Japanese, he flew into a rage, whipping his horse every time he swore against the Japanese, until my friend cried out for him to stop.</p>				<p>Transcripts of Wainwright's speech were broadcast at 1300 and 1700.  Manila was terribly sad but no less loyal.  The BBC report of a naval battle around the Solomon Islands will be on the agenda for <em>discussions</em> tomorrow, and hopefully spirits will perk up.</p>				<p>Mrs. Tamesis went to see her husband — a Captain at O'Donnell.  They got to within 15 paces from each other when a Japanese officer stopped him with three vicious slaps.  Then he turned and slapped the approaching wife once, saying, "You go Manila — don't come back."  Mrs. Zobel was also turned back, but she returned with an officer escort provided by Homma, and so was able to see her husband for five minutes.</p>				<p></p>				<p></p>				<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
