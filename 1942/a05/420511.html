When Paco Gutierrez came in claiming it was a Japanese victory and Australia was doomed, I gave him a piece of my mind.  And yet I notice that a few have moved towards the Japanese side. </p>								<p>One headline today is a quote from Madrigal's recent speech: "<i>Filipinos Have Much to Learn from Japanese.</i>"  Even the Spanish Consul wrote a letter congratulating the Japanese for their victories here.  Someday these fellows will regret their words.</p>								<p>Propaganda vehicles are still making the rounds of the city.  After a speech in Tagalog by one propagandist, he shouted Banzai three times though his small audience of curiosity-seekers remained silent.  At the Avenue Theater recently, one member of the audience started clapping loudly after a newsreel ended with a Japanese flourish.  He stopped after five claps when nobody joined him.</p>				<p>Last night the Japanese Navy gave us a light show with their searchlights.  A few places in the <a href="../../_maps/ermita_malate.html">Boulevard</a> have been ordered vacated to make room for Japanese officers.  A rumor making the rounds says that now that the Bay is open to Japanese shipping, all our cars and steel will be shipped to Japan. </p>				<p></p>				<p></p>				<p></p>				<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
