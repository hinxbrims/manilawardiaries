He prevailed on him to put in a good word for us.  He also told me quietly that the reason the pursuit planes were up two days ago was that an American submarine had torpedoed and sunk a number of merchant ships just outside the Bay.  Well, if anyone knows these waters well it would be the U.S. Navy.</p>				<p>I decided to pay a visit to the Astoria alone for a cup of java.  I sat there, serenely reminiscing about all recent visits and looking over the lay of the land so to speak.  Who's the stooge — a waiter?  One German fellow who was there today comes to mind.  Or it could be the slimy-looking casual acquaintance that sidled up to me two days ago and asked, "Sa-ay, who did win the Kharkov Battle?"  Fortunately I answered, "Depends on who you want to believe."  A moment later he tried a different tactic: "Business is so bad even the prostitutes are broke.  The Japs have just brought in a lot of girls from Shanghai and Formosa."  I ignored him and left soon after.</p>				<p></p>				<p></p>				<p></p>				<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
