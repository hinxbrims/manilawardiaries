Since we were probably indiscreet, the Swiss Inn is out for us as a group.  Schaer won't miss us — the Astoria is crowded.  My concern is this diary — as soon as I finish this notebook it's joining its predecessors underground.</p>								<p>A Japanese truck loaded with Filipino laborers and two Japanese soldiers passed a carromata in which Frank Brady was riding with a white girl and a companion.  Suddenly, the truck stopped and both soldiers ran up to the carromata, had the two riders get out, and then proceeded to kick the girl in the butt so many times that he thinks she'll hardly be able to walk again.  He admitted he turned away feeling sick in the gut.  In Escolta, some dumb fellow was caught trying to snatch a Japanese Officer's wallet.  Three Japanese worked him over and he lost three front teeth.  They tied and pummeled him in the stomach until he collapsed then carted him away in a carromata.</p>				<p></p>				<p></p>				<p></p>				<p></p>				<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
