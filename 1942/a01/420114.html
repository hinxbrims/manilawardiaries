Our side chose to leave things as they are until the fighting has ended.</p>								<p>I heard KGEI describe Washington as “quietly elated” after MacArthur smashed another Japanese offensive.  Truth is the Japanese underestimate the defenders in Bataan.  The jungle is a great equalizer, offsetting Japanese superiority in the air and ground.  The contest must end though, when our food and ammunition runs out.  The Tokyo Nichi-Nichi estimated there are 50,000 Filipinos and Americans in Bataan.  It could be double that if civilian refugees joined the USAFFE on their retreat.  Rumors say Bataan is on short rations.</p>								<p>Our own propaganda must now confront reality.  There’s nothing “sickly” or “starving” about the husky Japanese soldiers I’ve seen so far; and talk of their lack of resources and equipment is baloney — maybe in a year or two but not now.  In fact, Manila is full of idle equipment and troops with an excess of supplies — mute testimony to which are the stationary trucks at the Burgos School.  Thirty-seven days of war and Japan hasn’t been touched.  (Page Knox!)</p>								<p>The Tribune today published a list of 17 acts punishable by death, including the spreading of rumors, not accepting military currency, or hiding “provisions.”  Back at Bataan, especially around Mount Natib where a fight is on, no pretext is required for a death sentence.</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
