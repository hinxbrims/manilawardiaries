On their way downtown, Dad got stopped and searched four times; Frenchman Norman Bernard ten times, and Maurice twice on his bike.  Most stores remained closed for the day.</p>								<p>The takeover of the city was peaceful and orderly.  The Japanese don’t want trouble here because their troops are needed elsewhere.  So far they’ve limited themselves to confiscating cars and taking over hotels, kicking out the American civilians at the Manila Hotel.  One Chinese gent probably couldn’t stand the thought of living under Japanese rule ... he hanged himself.</p>								<p>The Japanese announced reasonable “conditions of the occupation.”  Commander in Chief Masaharu Homma’s message in the first issue of the <i>Japanese</i> Tribune:</p>								<blockquote>Regardless of nationality, no one is necessary to flee.  Making or taking hostile action against the Jap Armed Forces in any manner, leads the whole native land into the ashes.</blockquote>								<p>The paper had this to say about the newly issued occupation currency: “The Japanese Government takes full respect for their usage, having the correct amount to back them up.”  It “must” be accepted on equal terms to the Philippine Peso.  The bills have no serial numbers, and the largest denomination is Ten Pesos.  Rice is now rationed at one ganta per buyer [about 3-liters for 15-1/2 centavos].
