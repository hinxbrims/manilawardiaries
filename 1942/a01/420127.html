I rushed out and heard the drone of a single airplane.  The blackout siren rang as the Burgos School lights went out, but the streetlights and the lights of about half the houses stayed on.</p>								<p>The purpose of this single plane became clear when four more arrived around midnight to finish the job — the fields by then out of action or illuminated by the first plane’s bombs.  The siren went on again and antiaircraft opened up — ten big ones from <a href="../../_maps/sanlazaro_det.html">San Lazaro</a> racetrack — better than anything we ever had.  The planes dropped a volley of bombs then strafed the airfields, making a total of four passes.<sup>†</sup></p>								<p>Our sales girl, Lolita, who lives in Pasay, confirmed that Nichols was bombed and strafed.  The Japanese blocked the area off in the morning.  No one was allowed in while trucks massed outside to evacuate the base.  Isidro said one plane roared so low above his Pennsylvania Street house that he thought it had been hit, but it was on its way up.  He confirmed that plenty of trucks passed his house on the way there this morning.  Schaer, on a hill in Mandaluyong, said he saw tracer bullets and heard 20 bombs.  A few speculated that the pilot of the first plane idled his engine and glided down to the target silently before roaring away scant minutes before antiaircraft responded.</p>								<p>The Japanese were caught by surprise.  The Tribune was late today as its windows weren’t blacked out and it had to shut down.  The Japanese have converted Manila into a tremendous armed base.  Their officers sleep at the Manila Hotel, the American High Commissioner's residence, Avenue Hotel, Bay View, Leonard Wood, Elks Club, etc., as if a war wasn't on.  This morning some Japanese planes patrolled overhead while others went out looking for the culprits.  Manila is cheerful; I certainly feel great.  Common reference to last night’s bombing goes like this:</p>								<p class="dialogB">— “Hear the music last night?”</p>								<p class="dialogA">— “Yep, hope we have a concert next time.”</p>								<p>The Tribune dismissed the raid saying one plane was driven off by antiaircraft — that’s all.  By the time La Vanguardia was out, the Japanese required a stronger response to the buzz in Manila.  It mentioned only two “small” planes; called the night bombing cowardly; said a blackout was unnecessary and “due notice” would be given when one was required; and don’t believe rumors of “fifth columnists” — <i>they’ll all be shot!</i>  Said the target of the bombing was ... are you ready for this? ... Santo Tomas University!</p>								<p style="text-align: center"><br>. . . .</p>								<p class="footnote"><sup>† </sup> Two planes out of Bataan Field struck Nichols.  Expecting friendlies, the Japanese turned on the runway lights in welcome! Six planes struck Nielson and Nichols in the second attack.  All returned safely. — Ed.</p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
