				<p class="first">Still no milk, and bread is now rationed at ten-centavos per sale.  Maurice waited in a long line and finally gave up.  At least we had two blessed events today: six chicks each from our hens and turkeys.</p>
				
				<p>The Japanese bombarded Corregidor for 5 hours yesterday, killing 13 and wounding 35 though causing little military damage.  Over here, they’re having a ball riding around in large expensive cars or learning to drive at the <a href="../../mapper/sth_malate.html">La Salle</a> football field.  Manilans were treated to Laurel and Hardy scenes as the Japanese played with their new toys.  I observed a convoy with two trucks of soldiers, two motorcycles and a car stop and park near the Escolta.  The bigshot got out of the car and painstakingly closed every window before locking the front door.  It was all so unnecessary, and anyway, he forgot to lock a rear door.</p>
				
				<p>Got a call from Paul E. Meyer, asking for a news update.  Like so many other Ally families he was stuck at home, nervous but uncomplaining.</p>
