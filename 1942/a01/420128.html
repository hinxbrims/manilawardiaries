Tribune coverage followed La Vanguardia’s, adding that the Santo Tomas bombing exposed the “inhumanity of America.”  Radio Tokyo said Japanese planes bombed Rangoon at midnight (cowardly hour, eh?).  Also, the lack of “notice” for last night’s unofficial blackout confused many.  I called and got official confirmation from the police.  The planned extension of the last streetcar service from 1845 to 2100 didn’t take place yesterday and has now been postponed indefinitely.</p>								<p>I see one of our mosquito boats got another Japanese ship in Subic.  Seems the airpower of NEI, Burma and Australia is being strengthened and the blitz is slowing.  The offensive in Bataan has bogged down, and now Nichols Field has been evacuated.  I sense Japanese confidence has been unsettled by MacArthur’s resistance.</p>								<p>The Japanese recently called a meeting of shipowners and captains and announced that stranded students would be sent home.  One captain was asked if he was prepared to take a few to our southern ports.  “Sure," he said, but he’d require an escort to clear a passage through Corregidor.  Asked the displeased officer:</p>								<p class="dialogA">— “Why? Can’t you just slip out?”</p>								<p class="dialogB">— “I have seen a lot of Japanese naval officers in town in the last few days but no Jap ships.  If you can’t come in, how do you expect me to get out?”</p>								<p>The interview was abruptly terminated.</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
