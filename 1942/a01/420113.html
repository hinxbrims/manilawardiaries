Rumors say they’ll take our radios next.  It’ll be interesting to see how much news we can get by reading between the lines.  Japanese morale is certainly high.  This morning at the Burgos School they made a lot of noise singing something resembling a short litany and humming as they drilled.</p>								<p>Mr. Menzi was finally released at the intercession of the Red Cross.  He was only lightly questioned.  When the interviewer asked him why he was there, he replied:</p>								<p>“<i>I’ve been waiting three days to find out.</i>”</p>								<p>No one knew what he was in for.  After undergoing what was more like a job interview, the officer attached a note to his passport, stamped it with his chop, and said, “<i>You keep this page.  Very important ... better than your passport</i>.”</p>								<p>The Philippine Red Cross is trying to take over management of Santo Tomas, and we hope they succeed; feeding eight there is a lot of responsibility, and it’s wearing us out.  Meanwhile many are suffering in the rice lines.  One fellow went berserk after four straight days of standing in line.  Alternate supplies are still available but at 150% the fixed price.  Where is the rice going?  A friend recently saw a large bowl of rice brought to a table at Villamor Hall.  He judged the amount “sufficient” for the six Japanese soldiers expected there.  To his astonishment, one arrived early and finished it all by himself!</p>								<p>The Japanese are also overwhelming jewelry stores with purchases.  If they don’t like the price, they pay half, stalk out, and you’re stuck.  Naturally, most of the good stuff has been hidden away.</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
