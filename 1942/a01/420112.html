It must irk the Japanese to see Corregidor and not be able to do anything about it, like the Germans seeing Dover from the French coast.  Only England can and will hold; Corregidor can’t — not without supplies.  We’re resigned to a war of more than a year’s duration and have food for almost six months if the Japanese don’t take it.</p>								<p>Biked to Santo Tomas this afternoon to deliver our biggest load of food yet — 3 loaves of bread, 16 hard-boiled eggs, cans of milk, sardines and fruit juice.  We noticed the Japanese have taken over most schools to house their troops.  Last night a large contingent settled in the Burgos Elementary School just over the fence from our chicken coop!  I can see them from our porch.  They’ve just stopped singing and are settling down for the night, though typically, the building is ablaze with light.</p>								<p>The Japanese forces are well organized.  In Manila alone they have double the equipment MacArthur has, though they intend to use our food and alcohol.  They took 320,000 liters of alcohol-fuel from Tabacalera alone.  On the other hand, consider my new bike: Dunlop English tires; American seat, chain and pedals; German axles and gears; Japanese tubes and assembly.  The insignia is a gold piece saying, “20 $ U.S.A. In God We Trust.”  Beneath that in very small letters: “<i>Made in Japan</i>.”</p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
