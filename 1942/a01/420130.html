I got up, wondering if they expected an air raid.

Many asked in fear, “Do I HAVE to?”</p>								<p>In the afternoon, the Japanese interviewed Escolta merchants in detail about business and sales to Japanese.  Holders of gasoline were also called to sell their stocks at the prewar price of P3.80 per 5-gallon can.  Early in the occupation, Schaer was asked how much beer he had.  He reported 20 cases, but wanted seven-pesos per case and not the five being offered.  Eventually, they agreed on four cases at P5.20 each, but the Japanese left only P20 on the table.  The last laugh was Schaer’s — he had more than 20 cases.</p>								<p></p>								<p></p>								<p></p>								<p></p>							</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
