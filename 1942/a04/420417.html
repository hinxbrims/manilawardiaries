Corregidor defenders say they can take another 209 of such raids.  So I guess we too should be able to endure the rain of vicious propaganda.</p>				<blockquote>Due to the shortage of food on the Bataan front, the Filipino soldiers were not even given a bit of rice. Claiming that the Filipinos did not want to obey their orders, the Americans resorted to striking or kicking the Filipino soldiers and subjected them to these cowardly acts from morning till night.</blockquote>				<p>The story I've heard is that the Americans distributed food equally, and some Filipinos actually felt bad because the Americans were less used to the deprivations.</p>				<blockquote>All the Filipino boys in Bataan wanted to surrender to the Japanese forces, and they escaped from the American camp one by one and went to our side.  The Filipinos made their escaping in great haste for fear that if they were caught by the Americans, their bodies would be covered with gasoline and set on fire.</blockquote>				<p>No doubt many tried to filter away through Japanese lines towards the end, but I've also heard stories of Filipinos wanting to fight on in Corregidor. </p>				<blockquote>Even the captives' dress show American tyranny.  American captives wear khaki uniforms and steel helmets and every soldier is shaved and they show themselves like dandies, while Filipino soldiers wear worn-out drenched uniforms.</blockquote>				<p>We've already seen how pitiful the POWs looked.  Even the Tribune mentioned it on April 16:</p>				<blockquote>On the road near the refugees' camp, we saw American prisoners marching in groups, each group consisting several thousand.  They were untidy and their clothes were in shreds.  One gigantic soldier had a long dirty beard.</blockquote>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
