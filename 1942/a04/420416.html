At least those bombs will not fall on Corregidor.  The planes that hit Nichols came from Australia though they refueled in Mindanao.</p>								<p>Yesterday's temperature reached 37.5C, and another scorcher today is melting the asphalt on the roads.  According to Hans, Jacinto (a friend of his and fellow player of the Los Tamaraos Polo Club) told him American POWs were force-marched up to San Fernando then put into boxcars and sent to Tarlac.  He saw them above San Fernando, lying in the open sun, begging for water.  Those that needed medical attention weren't getting any.  Others unable to walk had to be helped by weakened comrades.  He was stunned speechless at the sight, which he described as "a nightmare."  The American Red Cross had asked permission to feed, aid and supervise the POWs but was curtly turned down.  So Jacinto went to Malacañan and demanded that Vargas get the Philippine Red Cross to do something about it — without success.</p>				<p>Japanese propaganda reached bizarre heights today, blaming the Americans for everything bad and praising the Japanese for everything good.  The best line says:</p>				<blockquote>As the interview came to an end, the Jap reporter could see tears streaming down the boy's cheeks.  The Jap could not help asking himself, 'Are those tears for the cruelties he and his companions have suffered from the Americans, or are they meant for the kindness they received from the Japanese?'</blockquote>				<p>M.S. Victoriano of KZRH admitted that at Orion, <i>"thousands of hungry, thirsty Filipinos and American soldiers had not eaten for days nor had any water to drink....  Many of the soldiers collapsed due to the heat, lack of nourishment and water."</i>  He then did an about face and began speaking of the kindness of the Japanese in giving food, water and drinks!  <i>"And some not far day,"</i> he said, <i>"they may yet — and I have been assured they will — find their way back to their loved ones."</i>  Dead, no doubt.</p>				<p>From different sources comes the tale of a Filipino cigarette peddler who threw a pack of cigarettes at a truckload of American POWs.  Japanese soldiers promptly chased him and beat him.  "You know," said Maurice just now, "the Japs have lost the Philippines forever.  They had the chance to win over the Filipinos and they muffed it.  Now they'll be hated forever."  Tonight, Tokyo blissfully sleeps in the belief the Filipinos have been won over.  Nothing could be further from the truth. </p>				<p></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
