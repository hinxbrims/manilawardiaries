Jamming completely blocked KGEI and BBC signals but I got the BBC at night confirming the sinking of 2 NEI cruisers.</p>								<p>BPI accountant, Palomares, told me pro-Chungking Chinese are allowed to withdraw only P200 monthly while the limit for pro-Nanking Chinese is P500.  They have to sign an affidavit as to their loyalty first, which only a few bothered to do (though a fearless handful signed as pro-Chungking!).  Most will just forego withdrawing funds.  Said a fellow who needed the money: “What the hell’s the difference of a piece of paper.”</p>				<p>The buzz today is of Benigno Aquino’s speech to the governors and mayors of Bicol province.  He said the U.S. is our real enemy because she compelled us to enter the war.</p>				<blockquote>All this I tell you is the truth as you know it.  For this reason those who are still in the American army and fighting against the Japs should raise the white flag and come over to the side of Japan to defeat the Americans and British.<br>				. . . .<br>				I wish to tell you that this war will come to an end with the triumph of Japan.  The victory of Japan will also be a victory for Philippines and all Asiatics.  For this reason, I pray for the success of the Japanese army in this war.				</blockquote>								<p>It was pretty strong even for Aquino — but did he really say it?  A close friend of Aquino told him: “Chico, this is not the time to mix words and phrases and say the things you’re saying.  Your previous speech was too strong.”</p>				<p>“On my word,” answered Aquino, “the Japanese took my Spanish speech and twisted it completely [on translation], and they even left out one important paragraph.  I insisted that they correct it.”</p>				<p>My source — 100% Filipino, loyal to the U.S. and worried about the U.S. reaction — said, “If only one-tenth of what he said is true, we Filipinos have the right to shoot him.”</p>				<p>According to a fellow named Poblador, several weeks ago Aquino suggested to Supreme Court Justice, Laurel, that they should cooperate with the Japanese.  “After all,” he said, “the Japs promise us independence and all.”</p>								<p>Laurel was cautious and inclined to stay in the clear: “I am neither a Jap nor an American.  I am just a Filipino, and just at this moment, circumstances considering, I am inclined to keep my own counsel and remain just a Filipino.”</p>								<p style="text-align: right" class="inLink"><br><a href="420304b.html"> continues...</a></p>			</td>		</tr>	</table>		</div><!-- ***************** FOOTER ***************** -->		<div class="footer">				&nbsp;	</div><!-- **************** NAVIGATOR **************** --></div>		</body></html>
